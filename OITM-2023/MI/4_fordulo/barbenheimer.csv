9.0,Barbie is On Her Way to the Oscars,Mini135,19 July 2023,"When I first knew there was a Bar
bie movie in production, a live action, I thought ""It should be as bad as the others movies""... When I notice was Greta Gerwig making the movie, my expectation get higher. Then, when I saw the cast, my expectations were even higher!I went to watch this movie in the premiere and I can assure you this movie is a masterpiece.It's purposely not realistic, has an excellent director and an excellent production and story.There are lots of fun moments, but this movie is a satire to the life of Barbie.The fact that compares the dream life of Barbie to the real life in the real world it's fantastic. It's a never seen thing. It compares the women's mistreatment, the real tragedy's... it's a real good idea... Everything in this movie is really good. Go watch this movie. It deserves you attention.",Barbie3.0,"Unfortunately, too much politics",gabrielddimitrov,23 July 2023,"The comedy was ok at times. Otherwise, this movie has a modern political agenda, and this is probably one of the reasons why it is highly rated. I understand the need for awareness of women's rights, possibilities, and freedom. It's here even in the 21st century, especially in some countries. However, I'm not sure if movies like this could succeed in giving the good message, or make it even worse, as sometimes the movie is disgustingly misandrous. Not to say that the overall experience of the content was not like a movie, but more of a parody of a movie. I love Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but this piece is definitely overrated.",Barbie
3.0,Why did I waste my time?,brocklawmurphy,23 July 2023,"This movie was a massive let down. It was never really funny and just kept pushing political issues in my face. I don't care about politics when I'm watching a movie, and I expect a well written story. This film is just bad, and I was actually interested in it. I had high expectations for this film and I think it did not deliver. It's not a valid social commentary because it does not prove there even is a patriarchy and give an example in real life. Actions speak louder than words and this movie is so overrated that I created an account just to leave a bad review. What did I even see in this film? It's a BARBIE MOVIE.",Barbie
9.0,Simply Outstanding,brentsbulletinboard,24 July 2023,"Telling the story of a larger-than-life individual truly calls for a larger-than-life film, and that's precisely what writer-director Christopher Nolan has come up with in his latest feature outing, handily the best work of his career. Nolan's three-hour opus about the life of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), director of the Manhattan Project (and more commonly known as the Father of the Atomic Bomb), provides viewers with a comprehensive biography of this brilliant and thoughtful yet often-inscrutable and naïve physicist who took on a patently dangerous venture that left him morally conflicted about the nature of his creation. The story, which spans several decades of the scientist's life, chronicles his development of ""the gadget"" and the fallout he suffered as a consequence of his left-wing political leanings and his efforts to keep the released nuclear genie from getting out of control. The film is admittedly a little overlong and probably could have used some editing in the opening and final hour, but, in the interest of telling the whole story of Oppenheimer's odyssey, its length is understandable (and, consequently, justifiable). The picture's production values are all top shelf, especially its brilliant cinematography, stirring original score and superb sound quality, an element that truly leaves audiences with a bona fide visceral experience. Moreover, the narrative is skillfully and eloquently brought to life by this offering's outstanding ensemble cast, including Murphy, Matt Damon, Tom Conti, Benny Safdie, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Gary Oldman, Rami Malek, and, especially, Robert Downey Jr., who delivers a stellar, award-worthy supporting performance showing acting chops that I never knew he possessed. ""Oppenheimer"" is easily the best film of the summer movie season, if not all of 2023 thus far. It packs a potent punch and delivers a message that we can all never hear too often, poignantly reminding us all of the importance of not falling prey to the same Promethean burden that Oppenheimer was forced to shoulder.",Oppenheimer
10.0,10/10!!!!!!!,meltingmel,21 July 2023,"Wow. WOW!!!!My favorite movie of all time is Aliens. It's been my favorite movie since I was 5-years-old. I'm 38 now. That has NEVER changed.Until THIS.And I bet you are thinking this review is satire. It's NOT.I'm BLOWN away. Barbie is now my favorite movie of all time - successfully unseating Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. I never thought I would see the day.The movie makes you think it's going to be just a fun, silly movie to mock. NO. It's not. It's brilliantly written. It's written so well that all the adult messaging goes right over the little kids heads but still gives them plenty of enjoyment.The movie sparked really great discussion with my daughter who is 8-years-old. We discussed why it's so important to value ourselves and what the patriarchy is. It's just... mind blowingly good.And also - a good reminder to all women. WE ARE ENOUGH. We are good enough. And we need to raise our daughters to be confident and leaders if that's the path they choose.",Barbie
10.0,So much fun!!,thelmaelise,26 July 2023,"This is such a unique film! It was so much fun, and had its sweet moments as well! All the choreography was excellently done. The costumes were amazing! I also loved the take Greta had on barbie, and some real problems women and men face. I truly feel like this was such a special movie- and it does not feel like anything I have ever seen before. It was also very funny! (And that's coming from someone who does not like comedy's) I was giggling all the way through the movie. So sad that this gets so much hate, I just feel like it's such a fun movie that everyone should see. So much fun!! Greta Gerwig has done it again!",Barbie
5.0,hot pink cotton candy mess,exlana,25 July 2023,"Barbie is a hot pink mess, that ironically sees world in two dimensional black and white. Aside from Margot and Ryan, all the characters are literal one dimensional bimbo.Yes, i'm aware of the over the top humour, and almost cartoonish art direction is intentional. Yes, there's supposedly more 'substance' , than the style's portrayed. But the message is so generic, and only on surface level that nothing that hasn't been done before.TO BE FAIR, some part of it is actually enjoyable, and i had a few laugh. Margot and Ryan are great, but the rest of the casts is awkard. And the ending is kinda nice. Overall it's ended up being a 'meh' for me.5/10 Puking rainbow.",Barbie
10.0,Creatively Brilliant,lisacarlson50,22 July 2023,"Brilliantly written by Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach. Everyone in this is fantastic. It's a wink at nostalgia and commentary on society. Never played with Barbies but my daughter did. Tribute to the inventor of Barbie, Ruth Handler. Helen Mirren narrates. Kate McKinnon almost steals the movie. Not a movie for little kids but most of the references will probably go over their heads. My girlfriend and I laughed out loud many times. It's about 20 minutes too long for my taste. The music is spot on. It's a perfect summer movie. Guess what? It has value and substance. Margot Robbie is not only gorgeous but more importantly, she's highly intelligent as actor and producer. This movie is going to make bank!",Barbie
10.0,Not even a great mind can figure out Humans,thePopcornExplorer,25 July 2023,"It's just astonishing how with such high expectations from everyone, Nolan still manages to deliver this master work, he has been my favorite director for quite some time, and there were many occasions where his films felt unrecognized (not by his peers which ultimately is more important) but by the award community, I hope this year things change.Cinema in its purest form, a high pace thrilling experience, one of the first aspects that amazed me about this movie in fact is that it's a biopic, and most biopics no matter how interesting the person they are telling the story about is, they tend to become tedious but somehow Nolan transformed this into an anxiety inducing exhilarating story.It feels as tragic as educational, while Nolan did an amazing job finding that balance of simply telling the story from Oppenheimer perspective without polarizing the political matters in place, and potentially antagonizing his audience, this is still a cautionary tale.How is it that we as a species manage to achieve greatness and we go back to our most tribal instincts when it comes to harm each other?How is it we are so good in bringing people together and with such great minds we have in the world we point them to fabricate the weapons of our own destruction instead of fomenting that knowledge and apply it to make our species a better peaceful version of ourselves?This movie has many layers to it, but the one that sticks out the most is redemption, we corrupt the people who are responsible for the development of our civilizations and contribute to further our knowledge and we discard them unless there's a use for them in the big war machine.Its hard to make a review about the film but be mindful that this is indeed a masterpiece, it's not the usual mind bending Sci-Fi experience Nolan usually creates, it might be even scarier as its an actual real life story that we should all learn from it and I can't finish this review without mentioning the Oscar worthy performances from Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Barbenheimer 2/2,mickeythechamp,24 July 2023,"Oppenheimer is an interesting movie from Christiopher Nolan. It feels like him, yet not at all. The idea of tackling a real-life event and one of the most important geopolitical events in the history of man is so far from what I think of when I think of Nolan, yet the way it´s made makes it something just down his line. While not perfect, Oppenheimer delivers a thrilling and dark part of human history that is so interesting to follow and his full of emotions throughout.J. Robert Oppenheimer, the self-proclaimed father of the atom bomb is being questioned about his national security. At the same time the cabinet member Lewis Strauss is giving his two cents about Oppenheimer. We see everything of Oppenheimer's life, from his humble beginnings to the creation and reflection on the atom bomb.A thing I didn't expect this movie to be was a strong court drama. This is an incredibly tense movie where it´s mostly people talking and interrogating each other. While the movie is also about much more, the political aspect is in the forefront and the entire way of thinking in the atom age is called to question. How the American government wanted to make more weapons, how Oppenheimer delt with the creation of the atom bomb, a lot of moral questions that are all in a grey area. No one seems to be completely right here, even Oppenheimer is throwing away responsibility for what the atom bomb would be used for, instead of seeing himself as a ring in the water. The character assassination of Oppenheimer is interesting to hear, and the story is compelling.The character of Oppenheimer is very well done in this movie, yet I had some issues with it. I never felt like I got under the skin of Oppenheimer. I never really learned what he thought of anything, and he deflects most question thrown his way. This was a smart decision to me though, not leaving Oppenheimer as a character that was always right but leaving the viewer making their own opinion of the events happening. This neutrality isn't kept for all characters though, and this leave Oppenheimer in a more favourable position automatically. I wished the movie had worked more in greys.This movie has some incredible artistic shots and scenes that really impacted me. The lead up and the test bombing. The speech in the gym, the entire 3. Act court drama, the ending. All left me really feeling and truly showed the talented acting of Nolan. This movie is carried by strong performances, a strong score and some really incredible ideas that just really hit me the right way.I most admit though, the first act of this movie I found rather weak. The personal life of Oppenheimer, especially his romance, feels highly unnecessary for the movie. His ties to the communist party will be important later for the story but it feels misplaced in the beginning somehow. The pacing is also something you have get used to. This movie is edited and moves very fast. It becomes better later, but in the beginning, I had a hard time following along.This movie has an all star cast and everyone gives it their all. Every single performance is absolutely incredible, and everyone sold their emotions and characters to me. Everyone really disappeared into their role, and I really got emersed into this movie. My favourite performance was no doubt Robert Downey Jr. As Strauss. What a powerful performance from start to finish, what a wide range of emotions that had to be captured, what a captivating performance through and though. It´s been a while since I saw such a strong performance from an actor and RDJ deserves all the praise he can for this role, but as said, everyone hits it out of the park in this one. Although as a Dane I found the attempt at a Danish accent laughable.This movie wears it´s political stance on its sleeves yet observes it from afar. It reminds me of the ending of Don´t look up (2021) in that way, but instead the entire movie. Oppenheimer starts a humble physicist who just want to work with fission and fusion, then when he gets to work on it, although through warfare, he is excited until he sees what he has created. The journey of a physicist that most accept what he has done is interesting and the later political assassination of Oppenheimer really hammers home the changed geopolitical world we live in and have to really have to address one way or another in the future.The score is incredible in this movie and really feels like a part of it´s identity. It feels constant in the background and really underlines everything going on in the movie. Especially the buildup to the testing is phenomenal as well as that entire scene. Pure tension and art.Oppenheimer really surprised me to what it would be in a good way. The story and reflection to our time of living really hit me and the story I didn't know was interesting. This is a strong artistic movie with so many incredible aspects. It´s not perfect but has these absolutely incredible aspects that makes it such a strong experience.",Oppenheimer
4.0,"Too long, boring, and scattered",OfficeMan1229,30 July 2023,"With so many high ratings, I figured this would be a really good movie, but I was disappointed. Many of the scenes are long and drawn out way beyond what they should be, and much of the movie is quite boring overall. The movie did have parts that were interesting and other scenes with a lot of tension, but they were a minority. This is a 3 hour movie, and I honestly think they could have trimmed this down to half that and made it 90 minutes and none of the story would be missed.The movie was also quite scattered, continually jumping around to different time periods which got annoying and made it a little hard to follow sometimes.I think this movie was over-hyped just because Christopher Nolan directed it. I can imagine a social experiment where this movie was released with Christopher Nolan's name concealed and instead an unknown director is listed. I'll bet in that case there wouldn't be anywhere close to the turnout this movie received and the rating would be something like a 6.Overall, it wasn't a terrible movie, but it certainly wasn't good either and I wouldn't recommend it.",Oppenheimer
1.0,The unnecessary sex scenes ruin and otherwise very good movie 9/10,rlymzv,25 July 2023,"The unnecessary sex scenes ruin and otherwise very good movie 9/10. We get about 2 hours and 57 minutes of physics, political intrigue, bureaucratic management, and 3 minutes of soft core porn that does NOTHING to move the film forward. As a student of physics, it was great watching a movie try to explain some of the problems in physics to the general public. Oppenheimer had a very high IQ, but along with that came some of his faults. It wasn't necessary to show these in bazaar way of him having sex in government meetings.I'm thinking about President Kennedy, you've probably seen the movies ""PT 109"" as well as the movie ""13 Days"". These two great movies were well received, and did a good job describing President Kennedy at various points in his life. They managed to do this without giving us sex scenes of President Kennedy with Marilyn Monroe, Gene Tierney, or others.The movie is already quite long (3 hours) the removal of 3 minutes would make it VASTLY superior and make the movie available to younger audiences who would also enjoy it. When the movie is available on home video, I will buy a copy and edit out the filth and make a much better copy for myself. There was no need to include total nude sex scenes in this movie. It takes away the concentration that the public had in the conversation that they were tying to have. Sadly that actress will be forever known as the naked chick in the Oppenheimer movie.Some will say the soft core porn was needed for the story. Just as not having a ""steamy sex scene"" prevents Casablanca from being a classic...",Oppenheimer
7.0,Just enjoy it. It's funny.,jcollins-458-415387,23 July 2023,"First off, I'm a 60 year-old white male and this movie wasn't even made for me.If your at all interested, then go see this movie. It's funny. It has a lot of funny lines and scenes.The recreation of the set is incredible, but maybe a little vidual indigestion. You adapt quickly.The characters are really good. Perfect for what they are expected to be. Both the main Barbie and Ken are excellently portrayed.There is a feminist overtone, but there is no lack of irony and mockery of both sexes. No one is asking you to be moved or to change your political or other persuasion. Just relax and enjoy it as a comedy.The people who criticize this movie for political or macho reasons are way out of bounds and are too easily swayed by today's political environment. This move is a funny comedy that might actually open your eyes to a feminist point of view of you choose to absorb it. If not, you'll still laugh and call it a good time.",Barbie
9.0,Cinematic masterpiece......It Might puncture the Academy Jury's Minds once again!!,ChandRath,21 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan, known for his technical brilliance, delves into the biographical genre for the first time with ""Oppenheimer."" putting a unique spin on the portrayal of the legendary figure. One notable aspect of Nolan's directorial style is his ability to focus on characters and their emotions. Similarly, he successfully attempts to depict the complex character of Oppenheimer, who, in reality, had two distinct sides.The first aspect celebrates Oppenheimer's role as the creator of the most powerful weapons known to mankind, while the second part sheds light on his realization that humanity now possesses the capability to potentially destroy the entire planet. Classic Nolan handles this duality of Oppenheimer's character amazingly, making the movie a thought-provoking experience for those who appreciate historical biographies and the moral dilemmas they present.Coming to the acting, I must say it's a masterpiece! The fusion of top-notch actors is exceptional, and everyone seamlessly belongs to that era. Cillian Murphy is absolutely perfect for the role; he elevates the film to new heights with his phenomenal performance, making it a true cinematic gem that will be remembered for years to come. And RDJ, his new avatar and performance solidifies the film's status as a cinematic gem. Their performances together are simply extraordinary, adding an unforgettable layer of brilliance to the movie.In summary, ""Oppenheimer"" may not appeal to everyone, but for science enthusiasts and history buffs, it offers a compelling and emotionally engaging cinematic experience.Nolan's masterful direction and the portrayal of Oppenheimer's complex character make this movie a worthwhile watch for those intrigued by historical and scientific narratives.",Oppenheimer
10.0,A Breathtaking Experience.,rafaelchris-98110,24 July 2023,"I was highly anticipating this movie since the trailer dropped earlier this year since I was a big fan of Nolan's Dunkirk. Going in, I was scared that this movie wasn't going to live up to my expectation but by the end I could say that it has surpassed it. The visuals were truly spectacular, the score was fantastic, cinematography even more so. Cillian Murphy's acting was very good as J. Robert Oppenheimer. I felt that he encapsulates the character of Oppenheimer very authentically and makes him a very complicated figure that we could all sympathise with despite being the father of one of the most destructive weapons that humanity has ever created. All of that couldn't have been done without Murphy's acting. The side characters were also pretty well played by their respective actors with my favourites being Lewis Strauss played by Robert Downey Jr. And Albert Einstein by Tom Conti. All of this combined making the movie one of the most engaging that I have seen for quite some time in theatres. 10/10.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Barbie Movie left me in tears,immauglydoll,20 July 2023,"I was super excited for the movie since the day they announced it and I've been looking forward to it. I was ready with my pink shirt, popcorn and tickets to the early screening expecting a fun loving and very pink movie.And it sure was a very pink and fun loving movie, but I was not expecting the turn it took. It made me go through so many emotions I wasn't expecting to feel, twist and turns that made me laugh, moments that made me cry and the ending was fantastic to say the least.The Barbie Movie is everything I was expecting and so much more, I think the highlight, other than the amazing message, casting and storytelling, was when John Cena appeared.In summary, I'm not the same person I was 1h and 54m ago.",Barbie

1.0,"Boring, long winded, tiring and annoying. Simply a flop.",bogdanmatiu,28 July 2023,"You will get a 3-hour movie that is not entertaining, not edifying, and not intellectually informative. The plot can be summarized in less than 5 minutes, therefore, you will get a lot of filling time when nothing really happens. Half o the movie is a combination of a boring meeting that never ends - you get one of these every day at work - and a mock trial. Moreover, add to it a lack of intellectual depth in all the conversations. The movie really misses the mark on all the aspects of plot/action, a shallow to no conversation/dialog between actors, unmoving/ordinary scenes, and a lack of character development. Add to it a continuous annoying sound that is meant to fill in stridently for the lack of emotion because the movie never gets going. If you don't like it, don't be afraid to recognize it because there is almost nothing to like. My recommendation is not to spend the time.",Oppenheimer
7.0,A lot like the Lego Movie - and there's a lot to like,Vic_max,29 July 2023,"As a guy who never played with Barbie dolls, I was surprised to be caught up in the enthusiasm to see this movie; I purchased tickets well in advance when they first went on sale.It's amazing to think that, a few years back, Amy Schumer was going to star in the title role. Though after seeing Margot Robbie, it's hard to imagine anyone else in that spot.Anyway ... like most moviegoers - I enjoyed this movie. It's a lot like The Lego Movie with its high energy, colorful world-building, meta jokes, self-aware characters and variety of insider (fan) humor. The ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" beginning, (clearly aimed at adult viewers) was priceless.However unlike The Lego Movie I can definitely say that the first half was enormously more entertaining compared to the second. The first half was energized by all the Barbie accessories, character introductions, high-energy music and a very cool plot reveal involving the ""real world"".But unlike The Lego Movie, the second half (while not bad) wasn't able to keep the momentum going. While there was a lot of action and drama ... it felt more hit-and-miss.The message was good: you don't have to be perfect to be happy ... just be true to yourself. However, its delivery felt a bit too complex for kids - and maybe even for some adults.The empowering commentary about womanhood was eloquent ... but it seemed like the writers had trouble getting from that point to a strong and uplifting ending. It almost felt a bit melancholy for whatever reason.But - don';t let that stop you from enjoying this movie! There's a lot to like and it's kind of a cultural moment and opportunity to connect with all the Barbie-love that spans generations. Enjoy this experience with a big audience and you'll be glad you did.",Barbie
10.0,The best film I have ever seen,dalegoodwin-07234,22 July 2023,I am a film enjoyed and I have seen many films and honesty I can say without a doubt in my mind Oppenheimer is the best motion picture I have ever seen from its breath taking cinematography to its incredible story telling its quite literally perfection.You may be thinking its only for people who enjoy and know a lot about science but it's not the case while yes their may be the odd term the average person might be unfamiliar with it is soon explained well and in detail but I will say it will certainly be more enjoyable to someone who knows a bit about science and enjoys films.You may also be thinking I would rather watch barbie well to that I say more fool you I have seen both and I can say without a doubt in my mind oppenheimer is better in every way shape or form.If you haven't seen it don't walk run to your nearest cinema and purchase a ticket you will not regret it I can guarantee it.,Oppenheimer

I'll never buy a ticket for Barbie.So take my advice and go get your tickets and have fun.. so that's my basic review for a movie I hope you liked it and if you disagree with me put dislike let me know if you like my opinion.. , :)",Barbie
10.0,Excellent Chemistry of Plot and Fandom!,sopmaker,21 July 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary piece of cinema that showcases the brilliance of Christopher Nolan's direction and the exceptional performance of Cillian Murphy. Nolan's intelligent filmmaking demands the audience's full attention, weaving narratives and time periods seamlessly to tell the captivating story of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Murphy's portrayal is nothing short of mesmerizing, earning him an Oscar-worthy performance as he navigates the complexities of this historical figure.Nolan's non-sequential storytelling style adds depth and intrigue to the narrative, immersing us in Oppenheimer's life, successes, and personal struggles. The film's runtime of three hours flies by, thanks to Nolan's expert pacing and the engrossing plot. The director's commitment to practical effects heightens the tension during pivotal moments, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats.Supporting actors, including Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh, deliver powerful performances, adding layers to the film's exploration of Oppenheimer's relationships and choices. Each character represents significant aspects of his life, making us question the price of scientific advancements during wartime.Nolan deftly explores the moral conflicts that shaped Oppenheimer's legacy, humanizing him beyond the label of ""the father of the atomic bomb."" The film delves into the consequences of his decisions and the burden he carried throughout his life. It successfully portrays Oppenheimer as a multi-faceted figure, neither a hero nor a villain but a flawed human whose actions changed the world forever.""Oppenheimer"" is not your typical biopic; it challenges the audience to ponder the ethical complexities surrounding the development and use of nuclear weapons. Nolan's direction and Murphy's performance make this historical figure relatable and thought-provoking. The film's brilliance lies in its ability to entertain while sparking meaningful discussions about the consequences of scientific discoveries and the impact of personal choices on a global scale.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a captivating and intellectually stimulating cinematic experience. Nolan's artistic vision, coupled with Cillian Murphy's remarkable acting, elevates this film to the pinnacle of biographical storytelling. It serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of responsible decision-making and the enduring effects of our actions on the world. A must-watch for film enthusiasts and history buffs alike, ""Oppenheimer"" exemplifies the finest form of filmmaking that both educates and entertains its audience.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Pretty Pink,ProRedLion100,25 July 2023,"Barbie is a beautifully heart-warming extravaganza for both boys and girls alike. A gloriously pink, joy-filled experience that I can't wait to go and see again. From the wonderful set design and perfect casting to the brilliant soundtrack and story to match, there is something for everyone to enjoy.I can't pay more respect to the cast, Margot Robbie as stereotypical Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken are the obvious standouts, they certainly delivered on the hype - but I was pleasantly surprised by Will Ferrell's short but hilarious moments on screen as well as Michael Cera as Alan (a true unsung hero).As mentioned, the set design is really quite stunning. Gazing upon Barbie land in all it's pink glory is pure joy, there is no doubt the set design is one of the films greatest strengths. But Barbie doesn't just look great, it sounds great with its vibrant collection of tracks and performances (including Ryan Gosling and his guitar).Barbie wraps up all the fun and colour with a solid story and strong positive message that fits perfectly in the world Greta Gerwig created. Of course some people may not enjoy the social commentary that pervades Barbie but I believe Greta Gerwig laid out the foundations for such a message perfectly, empowering girls and boys of all ages.Barbie feels like a must see movie, it built the hype and then delivered exceptionally. If you haven't been tempted yet you're missing out on all the fun that this beautiful movie has to offer.",Barbie
9.0,There is an art-house movie under all that pink,bjacob,21 July 2023,"I tend to gravitate towards French cinema and the classics; the idea of watching a franchise movie about Barbie seemed mildly repellent at first. Well, I am glad I kept an open mind.This is a riotously funny, zany meta comedy with touches of Wes Anderson and Bollywood; yet also strangely affecting. The idea of giving a plastic doll an existential crisis may seem gimmicky, yet it works. The cracks showing in the perfect façade of the perfect Barbie world are rendered through metaphors that hit the mark, full of a strange melancholia. I am usually put off by sentimentalisms: here, thankfully, they are kept at a bare minimum, even in the ending.Overall, I am astonished this film exists at all. I imagine the authors meeting with a slightly distracted Mattel executive, being given a gazillion of dollars with the vaguest of briefs, and running away with it, to make a film that would send any corporate committee into a tailspin -- I imagine a first projection with the producers fainting and having a heart attack -- yet also make them laugh all the way to the bank. However it happened, chapeau. I am glad I went, I'll buy the dvd as well. I can see myself rewatching it to be sure I got all the micro gags and layers of meaning, but also putting it on when I need a little pick me up.",Barbie
5.0,More of a marketing flick,shadowtramp,22 July 2023,"The brilliant marketing is what led us tonight to pay for the tickets. The brilliance ends there.Performance of the lead actors is very good - as good as you may expect given the very poor story and weak directing. And that's it. The humour is forced. The satire is replaced by lectures conveyed by characters. All the ""bad"" characters are absolutely flat, lacking any depth. Even dancing is very poorly choreographed. Whatever you may expect from the trailers is missing in the movie.The photography is good though. So the average is 5/10 It is another plainly bad movie that is trying to hide behind agenda.",Barbie
8.0,Pretty good,amatullahdaya,22 July 2023,"I have watched barbie since I was born, I've collected the dolls the dresses and many other barbie themed things. I know all the movies by heart and the songs and I love barbie so when I saw this movies trailer and the marketing I went crazy!! I was so excited to watch it and support this movie.The beginning of the movie was quite fun and funny, very colorful. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling play their roles so well and really carry the movie. It contained all the things expected from a barbie movie. The plot was great but halfway through the movie it becomes very serious and turns a bit preachy so if you want to take your kids to the movies to watch this, Id suggest not doing so because I don't think they'll understand much about patriarchy and sexism, its definitely not aimed at younger children (12 and below).I was hoping for some more funny moments and homage to the barbie movies so I was a tad bit disappointed not to see it however it was still a nice movie, enjoyable and a feel good movie.I understand the message given out that you can be whoever you want to be but it could have been slightly more light hearted .",Barbie
8.0,Welcome to the Dollhouse,aciessi,25 July 2023,"Barbie: the symbol of pink, pastel perfection. An iconic piece of American pop culture for more than 50 years.

Greta Gerwig takes Matel's historic creation, every triumph and failure in its catalogue, and places it all within a complicated and challenging critique of what it means to be a woman. If I could compare it to another movie, I would say it's very reminiscent of Robert Townsend's Hollywood Shuffle. It leaves you wondering what kind of insane negotiations went between the film's creative team and Matel, who is also one the targets of the film's purposeful ire. It is one thing to have completed this film, and absolutely another for it to have also gotten the overwhelming promotional campaign in the months leading up to its release. Gerwig's bet is paying off big time, and you have to admit, that takes a lot of guts.Concept alone certainly isn't the film's only strength. The film is beautiful to look at. The production design is second to none in its meticulous construction of a real-life Barbie paradise. Respectively, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling give fantastic performances with plenty of complexity and dimension. I was the most touched by Rhea Perlman who gives a heartwarming portrayal of the founding mother of Barbieland, Ruth Handler. Gerwig and Baumbauch's screenplay is biting and irreverent, and by the end, nobody is left unscathed. But equally so, I belly laughed quite often and marveled at how well so many of the jokes land. The emotional depth of the film also struck a very powerful cord, complete with an ending montage that can practically leave anyone misty-eyed.Having been released on the same day as Oppenheimer, it's safe to say that the event movie is back and better than ever. After three years of streaming, it can't be overstated how wonderful that is.",Barbie
7.0,Barbie is awesome,danielatala8,21 July 2023,"Let's just get it out of the way, I freaking love Barbie. So many memories and ideals are connected to her that even without the movie I still get nostalgic about. The iconography, the looks, Ken (~swoon~)... there was one problem though, I am a boy, I could never get a Barbie because my parents never would let me have one. Instead I stole my cousins mermaid Barbie and treated her like one of my most precious toys until she disappeared, perhaps she went into Barbieland? Greta Gerwig's movie seemingly let us tap into all of that and more thanks to a great PR team that I haven't seen work their magic since a long long time, in other words hype has been BUILT. How does it fare? I left the cinema with a smile but I wish that it could have something MORE. Let me explain down below.Barbie is a movie that is about Barbie, the doll, the idea, living in a world separate from reality called Barbieland a world where Barbie is everything, from the president to a Nobel prize laureate to a doctor. She runs this world in all her iterations, until the stereotypical Barbie somehow gets thoughts about death, she gets a flat foot (CHAOS!) and she gets cellulites (THE HORROR!)- she has to fix this by travelling in the real world with Ken and in this she meets a hard working mother and her cynical daughter- fun hijinks galore!This movie has got the aesthetics DOWN, like it's so pretty and so meticulously done with all the details, to how the actors act and how the worlds are built- this is more on how the Barbie world is, because when it mixes with the real world. That's where things get a bit complicated.Example; There's no actual ""real"" separation between Barbieland or the real world, meaning that the real world feels like a mirror flipped version of Barbieland where people act just as outlandish as the titular dolls. I kinda wish that Greta would've made a script that actually puts Barbie in real world, how it is right now, and I know that Greta is great at making reality feel relatable and recognisable and human but I felt there was not much of a difference. Maybe it was so that they could fill the whole Mattel-company storyline in it? Either way I wish that Greta would play more with these contrasts and fish-out-of-water-feelings.This in turn makes the other characters that should be relatable for the moviegoers- i.e. The daughter and the mother feel painfully flat and just unnecessary for the story overall, despite making them ""deep"" they felt honestly super flat, like dolls and stereotypes of characters in a movie. And I don't think that was Greta's intention, not if you see the movies that she's done before where there's always a singular perspective but here I think she's kind of confused on who to use the perspective the most on. Luckily it is Barbie and Ken for the most of the movie, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are doing a fantastic job at playing these characters and it's in their moments where the comedy shines the most.Another missed opportunity generally I think is just addressing the gay history that is tied to the Barbie brand. And how gay men like me were influenced by it- not to say that this was absolutely important for a movie like this but I still feel like it would've made sense, at least the gay doll of 90s Ken (who was made popular in the 90s due to being bought by mostly gay men) made an appearance, if only briefly. I know, I shouldn't make demands about this but I feel like there would've been something even more interesting with addressing all the boys that play with Barbie dolls, the ""real world"" feels very black and white in this sense. But I regress, this is just a tangent and a thought!I love the comedic and camp elements, I think they are what sustain the movie and the fashion of course. Also I love that it brings forth the themes of feminism as that is needed in a movie like this, I think that it does so in a great manner. Is it the movie that I wanted? Not really, but I'm glad that it exists, I'm glad that I saw it. Maybe I was too much swayed by the whole PR marketing strategy but I really wanted this to be a new camp and fun fun classic. Instead it feels just good and that's ok. I wanted it to be more of an adult-oriented movie and maybe that's where Greta kind of flubbed it, trying to make it both kid and adult friendly but she honestly doesn't succeed at neither and that's alright.",Barbie
8.0,Amazing,Frizzabel,27 July 2023,"I haven't written a review on IMDb before but I felt like I need to for this film.Genuinely one of the most heartwarming yet emotionally poignant movies I've seen for a very long time, and honestly the first movie I've genuinely felt understood by.It made me laugh it made me cry, I never expected the Barbie movie of all things to stick like it did and strike a chord with me. This is a movie that links directly into my experiences as a woman and perfectly encapsulates what it feels like to be under the societal pressures of being a woman and the impossibilities we face every day. America Ferrera's monologue was incredible.Honestly, I'd recommend this film to anyone and feel like it's crucial that it gets the recognition it deserves. Greta Gerwig is a phenomenal director and I can't wait for her next project.",Barbie
10.0,Well deserving of the hype,eleanorcrawlings,21 July 2023,"This is the first time I've written a review for a movie, that should tell you that I enjoyed this movie an awful lot.The storyline grabbed my attention at every corner and the soundtrack continues to ring in my ears and evoke a feeling of confidence in myself and pure joy. It really focused in on it's female audience and was able to accurately portray the modern day plight of the average woman. I didn't expect to cry during this movie but I had never felt so understood and empowered to be myself.Margot Robbie was Barbie, she managed to uphold the whimsy and joy of Barbie throughout the tough political statements that with any other actress would have depressed the audience. Ryan Gosling never failed to make me laugh in his role as Ken, he was perfect for this role and I can't imagine anyone else fulfilling it to the same standard. The supporting Barbies and Kens also excelled in their roles adding to the character and world of Barbie.I have spent some time reading other reviews which have complained that the 3rd portion of the movie was too heavy handed in its feminist perspective and that its blunt political message didn't properly encapsulate Barbie. To that I say; The 3rd portion is less than 40 minutes long, if you can't listen to women's issues for that little time without getting bored then maybe you're not getting what we're saying. And this movie was actually about Barbie, unlike the animated Barbie movies which merely starred Barbie. This movie is actually about Barbie and her extensive history as a controversial doll that had to fight tooth and nail to make it into the hands of little girls and inspire them to be more than mothers.Overall, Barbie was incredible and I hope she inspires even more little girls through this movie than she already has.",Barbie
10.0,Much more than I expected,bojanasormaz,20 July 2023,"I expected a funny, easy-going movie that you can watch while scrolling on your phone. I was amazed by the depth of the story. Feminism done right, without the overly woke culture that is cringey and contraproductive in most cases. A must see if you're capable of seeing beyond the pitch perfect pink world. :) Wasn't sure about Ryan Gosling as Ken, the match seemed off, but after seeing the movie I think he did great. Helen Mirren is the narrator which is also amazing. Beautiful story abour equality, feminism, finding your role in the world and also about the importance of finding yourself in the big world.",Barbie
10.0,Beautifully done movie,stevieltamasi,21 July 2023,"I have never felt move validated as a woman as when I watched this film. It is so beautiful and meaningful while also being witty and funny, this is what a movie is supposed to be. You are supposed to be on the verge of tears and the next minute laughing, it's an experience. Although men will watch this and enjoy it, they won't understand it or how validating it is as a woman to watch. This movie was something I hope every little girl will watch and every woman will watch so she can feel validated. This movie is so meaningful and I hope people will see behind the glitz and glamour and see the sentiment behind it. I'm so happy this movie has been created and I've never watched a film that so beautifully shows how complex it is to be a woman and how the patriarchy damages everyone in it but mostly women. It was deeper that barbie and pink and silly. It's also interesting how the dialogue is from a child's perspective of playing with a doll. It took me back to being little and playing with my dolls and thinking anything was possible and not feeling guilty about liking girly stuff, or wearing pink. So well done and definitely a conversation starter. I hope when mothers accidentally take their daughters to see this expecting something else they come out feeling good about being a woman.",Barbie
5.0,So much potential,jonketchum,29 July 2023,"I wanted to see this movie since the set pictures got leaked. Once they released the trailer and the clips, it was one of the most anticipated movies of the year for me.It started off great. It was hilarious. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were amazing. Then the actual comedy stopped. Jokes fell flat. The ""Barbie world"" they set up then just ignored the toy universe they spent 20 minutes setting up to put forth terrible gags and a preachy message that made no sense. For instance, Barbie could only bend certain ways in the beginning, then she can bend her body like a normal human, then she can't again for one joke, then she can again. It was awful.Normally, Will Ferrell is at least a little bit humorous. Even he was dry. The best part was a fake commercial halfway through it. I've wanted to get up and walk out so bad. I felt like it was also geared towards everyone in the beginning, and then adults in the last 75 minutes. It became too dramatic and preachy.The Lego movie managed to be geared toward the family and still gave a good message in the last few minutes. That should have been the route this took.",Barbie
8.0,I LOVE it!,elzepaliukaite,20 July 2023,"The movie did something that has never been done before. The details, the music, comedy, and my favourite.... the outifts!!! I could have never imagined that a movie with such entertaining characters and plot could be made based on a Barbie. I truly reccomend you warching this film, not only it is entertaining, but it reminds you how great it is to be independed and how to stay true to yourself. The movie also highlits the importance of talking about your emotions and how holding them im might lead to something worse.I have no doubt that this is the best Greta Gerwig's movie yet and I hope in the future she will spoil us with more fascinating stuff.",Barbie
9.0,"Brilliant acting, sound and direction",bharatsir,22 July 2023,"Within minutes of the movie you will be absorbed into it, mainly due to the stunning sound effects. Murphy has given the performance of his life. Brilliant movie. It explored all aspects including conception, generation, testing, deployment and the aftermath including accusations. No stone was left unturned.Nolan has delivered yet another masterpiece. Special mention fro the sound artists of this movie. This is definitely getting nomination or maybe even winning oscars in these departments 1) murphy acting 2) Nolan direction 3) SOUND ENGINEERINGKeep making such wonderful movies Nolan, more power to you.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Pay no attention to a review from an individual that can't grasp the use of an ellipsis.,mthendley,22 July 2023,"I can't think of an adequate superlative to describe Nolan's latest masterpiece.Seldom will I rate a motion picture with 10/10 but in this case, it is well-deserved.Cillian Murphy can expect to pick up his Oscar early into 2024 following an exemplary and unrivalled performance.The only thing I couldn't even force myself to enjoy was Emily Blunt's arguably excessive endeavours to portray a character that required much more subtlety.Make yourself comfortable, remove any distractions and enjoy the best 3-hours of your life...Nolan's flawless legacy continues to accumulate speed, and I look forward to his next production.",Oppenheimer
7.0,Much Deeper Than I Thought,aidandrain15,24 July 2023,"Going into the movie, i went in mostly blind and didn't expect much into the way it explored a deeper and more abstract plotline. Cast was star-studded and everything seemed to be in place, nothing off there. However, to me, the movie couldn't decide whether it wanted to be a more serious movie with a straight plotline or being goofy with a more abstract plotline. I think the humor was well-executed, but the movie leaned too much into both sides. By doing that, the potential in the movie if they had picked and focused on one solely was diminished. Excellent individual performances from ferrell, gosling, and greenblatt.",Barbie
10.0,The perfect example of show don't tell,krieg-frieden,26 July 2023,"It is a masterpiece in this manner: It plays over several years - and in multiple timelines (it's a Nolan of course it does)It also plays at multiple locations over those several years and not ONCE was it felt necessary to show a time or location stamp on screen and it worked brilliantly, I don't believe anyone would mix up the timelines or locations or don't feel like they know where or when they are as an audienceWhat do I mean by this? Well you know - oh now we are at this location"" without the movie telling you Washington - It also isn't the case with - how much time has passed? - no there are optical clues - others than simply aging the characters, more subtle and not forced.",Oppenheimer
10.0,"Whit, charm, and lots to say",greasefreak,21 July 2023,"This movie was fantastic. Leave it to the writers Greta and Noah to handle the topic of womanhood so well. The details on the set were outstanding. It even addresses some of how Barbie was created. Being on the theater surrounded by women watching this film felt like a significant moment.I will say to all the 1 star reviews and people who brought their 5 year olds to the theater, know your director. This was not a film created to advertise for Barbie, this was thoughtfully created by people who have written indi films and gotten nominated for Oscar's. They know what they want to say and why. The target audience for this film has to be old enough to understand words like Patriarchy which is used a lot in the movie. But don't let this deter you. There's enough music, humor, and and character development for Barbie and Ken to keep the audience entertained even if it's over their head.",Barbie
10.0,Absolute perfection,cefijani,27 July 2023,"If this doesn't sweep the Oscars for best actor, best supporting actors and best film and possibly cinematography, music and costumes then I don't know will. This film was stunning in its telling of a man, a genius a historical event that shaped the world I am a loss for superlatives.3 hours passed in a moment. I was enthralled the whole time. I am no physicist so was worried the science would confound me but it didn't.Nolan has created a masterpiece. The story telling is perfection the way the time line is juxtapositioned and shot in different textures really helps in understanding.Cillian Murphy fills every scene and strides across it like a colossus. He is sublime.RDJ acts his little socks off bringing such depth and feeling to the character.Matt Damon is also brilliant.I absolutely loved this film it is one of the best films I have ever seen. It was a pleasure and an honour to watch. It challenged my emotions and my intellect. Cannot recommend it highly enough.",Oppenheimer
7.0,Fun and not overly complicated,pri_e,22 July 2023,"I know there's been concern that the movie will be overly feminist because it was written by Greta Grewig. This movie manages to capture the right amount of feminism without taking itself so seriously. The standout performance is Ryan Gosling as Ken; I think he carried his role with the perfect amount of Kenergy. Margot Robbie is delightful as Barbie and gives her much heart.I think the movie would've worked better as a tv series to allow the writers to flesh out the characters a bit more. It would've been better if we understood more of what created the distance between Gloria and her daughter (See? I can't even remember her name). When did Barbie first start feeling that she wanted more than the same existence everyday. Why weren't the Barbies and Kens capable of understanding more than their world? Didn't their characters encompass their human counterparts?Anyway....the movie was fun, lighthearted and something for everyone to enjoy.",Barbie
7.0,Cute existentialism,Jithindurden,21 July 2023,"Barbie is exactly the movie the trailers promised. Different from what you expect from a toy adaptation but not fully up to the talents of the writers and director involved. An existential comedy for little girls and adults is the best way it can be described. It's very well made with the use of extensive sets and amazing actors in it. Entertaining throughout the movie even if it is mostly predictable. Great message even if it gets preachy a little bit, which surely is going to invite a lot of hate towards it too. It also shows different sides of the kind of issues in our world by juxtaposition. The self-awareness works to a point too. But the constant and blatant toy promotion kind of makes the whole thing almost pointless. I mean, I get it that Mattel only made this so they can sell their toys and was ready for the film to criticise them for the same but do they really have to overcompensate for that like this?",Barbie
5.0,Disappointing and misleading,enesmil,19 July 2023,"The movie starts great, but goes off the rails soon after. Had they kept the look and feel of the first 30 minutes, this movie could've been great.For positives, the cast is great in general. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling do a great job as ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and Ken. Barbieland also looks vividly colorful and full of references to the toys themselves anyone who played with Barbie toys will recognize.For negatives, It is not a fun movie at its core. The movie pits women against men and it has a negative and political messaging. It's a ""lecturing feminist"" and ""bring down the patriarchy"" kind of movie. I wasn't expecting it to turn out this way from the trailers and was honestly surprised by it.In general, if you're looking for a lighthearted movie about Barbies (and Kens) where you can kick back, relax and have some laughs, this movie is not it.",Barbie
10.0,Cinema is its most visceral form,revparu,21 July 2023,"It's rare to experience a movie like Oppenheimer in the contemporary Hollywood. This is Nolan at his best, using his experience in ways you'd never imagine.You are immediately hypnotised by the chilling soundtrack of Ludwig. The visuals and the brilliant dialogue are breathtaking.With a relentless pace that makes three hours go by inconspicuously. I somehow didn't realise how the last 30 mins of the movie passed by, and yet I felt like it could've used a few extra minutes.Condensing a book like American Prometheus into a 3 hour movie is a great feat.If this is Nolan's attempt at going for an Oscar, I wouldn't necessarily argue it. But I would add that this movie doesn't look like an Oscar bait. It's still got Nolan's touch.",Oppenheimer
7.0,What is Barbie?,glorifcus,28 July 2023,"Was I expecting more from great gerwig? Yes!Form the trailers, i never got a solid idea what Barbie the film was: a musical, a comedy, a coming of age story, a metaphor for something greater ? Maybe Barbie tries all of the above to a shallow extend. There are deep ideas introduced that immediately caught my attention. Several in fact, scattered strategically at the beginning, middle, and close to the end. The thing is that those ideas are never fully developed or forgotten in the case of one. The film comedy is pastels and pink like it's colors, but aesthetically speaking, not even its pastels are fully realized or pushed to the its full vibrancy like in a WES ANDERSON film. The jokes are bland neither too sophisticated for adults to get them, or charmingly innocent for kids to enjoy them. Margo does a good job as Barbie, but is good good enough for a leading role where the fantasy was being told to me, but I never actually believed it, Margo never looks like Barbie herself , aside the colors and the imposed name. She did what she could, but I never got the fantasy of Barbie. I believed Reese whiterspoon in legally blonde to be more Barbie like than Margo Robbie herself.The film has great refreshing moments like America ferrera's scenes , full of vigor life. Also. Ryan gosling gives an excellent portrayal of a ken with an existential crisis. The ending dancing number: fun and amazing. That number alone could potentially go for award nominations.Would I recommend the film to fans of Barbie, yes. Would I personally sit through to watch it again, no.All and all, I walked away the theater not knowing for sure what Barbie the movie was. It is the weakest project artistically from Greta gerwig. In Barbie, Greta's magic and quirky comedic take on like is muddle among so many different things thrown together; it looses the comedy of Frances ha, and the driving force of nature that is lady bird.",Barbie

10.0,Barbenheimer double feature 2/2,boodigar,25 July 2023,"The movie:I honestly think I enjoyed the movie better on the second watch as I was a lot less confused. This movie has tons of characters and names introduced at breakneck pace which makes it somewhat hard to follow. Going into it with an understanding of how the story will unfold made it much easier to understand. This film is honestly a pretty much flawless masterpiece and Nolans most profound and meaningful work to date.The constant intensity throughout is something I've rarely experienced in any films and is done to perfection. Cillian and supporting performances remain incredible. The visuals are impossibly beautiful and I genuinely cannot fathom how he managed to make them without CGI unless he is lying. The non-linear aspect of this film is the best Nolan has ever done it other than maybe Memento. The ending of this film is perfect, and without it I don't think I could score it nearly as high.The experience:Nothing can ever top the experience of seeing this opening day in IMAX with perfect seats, but this came close. This viewing was 70mm (not IMAX) but my first movie viewed on actual film, which was very cool.",Oppenheimer
10.0,A Subtle Masterpiece,jaysonpajaronvistal,21 July 2023,"In Christopher Nolan's 2023 film 'Oppenheimer', audiences are treated to a masterful cinematic experience that delves into the life and work of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the 'father of the atomic bomb.' The film is a meticulously crafted biographical drama that explores the complexities of Oppenheimer's character and the moral dilemmas faced during the creation of the world's most destructive weapon.Uncharacteristic of Nolan's filmography, 'Oppenheimer' delivers its narrative through quiet nuances that demand the audience's attention and engagement. For instance, a poignant scene where Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) wordlessly observes the destructive potential of his creation, the atomic bomb, beautifully captures this subtlety. The scene speaks volumes about Oppenheimer's internal turmoil, showcasing Nolan's skill in visual storytelling.The performances in 'Oppenheimer' are nothing short of stellar. Oscar-worthy turns from Robert Downey Jr. And Emily Blunt powerfully anchor the film, with Downey Jr.'s nuanced portrayal of his character adding a remarkable depth to the narrative. Emily Blunt's performance is equally compelling, delivering a magnetic charisma that captivates the audience. Despite her limited screen time, Florence Pugh makes a significant impact, further demonstrating her impressive range as an actress.In his first leading role in a Nolan film, Cillian Murphy delivers an extraordinary performance that is both deeply nuanced and profoundly moving. His portrayal of Oppenheimer is so compelling, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role. Murphy's performance is a masterclass in character depth that deserves an Oscar nomination.Unlike many of Nolan's previous films, 'Oppenheimer' is less about pyrotechnics and more about the character study at its heart. This dialogue-driven narrative creates a palpable tension that simmers throughout the film, giving it explosive energy even in the absence of literal explosions. This thoughtful approach elevates the film to a higher plane of storytelling, making Oppenheimer a richly rewarding cinematic experience.The screenplay, crafted with meticulous attention to detail, is another impressive aspect of 'Oppenheimer'. It blends historical facts with a deeply personal narrative, creating an engaging and thought-provoking story. The dialogue is packed with meaning, driving the narrative forward and revealing layers of character depth.This film's success highlights the critical role of writers in the film industry, particularly in light of the recent SAG-AFTRA strike. The strike underscores the need for fair compensation and treatment of writers whose creativity and labor are integral to the production of quality films like 'Oppenheimer'. Without their invaluable contribution, cinema would lack the richness, diversity, and depth that audiences around the world cherish.The film's one shortcoming, however, lies in the sound score. While the score itself is magnificent, its volume often overshadows the dialogue, making it challenging to discern what the characters are saying at times. This sometimes gives the impression that the characters are mumbling, detracting slightly from the overall experience.Despite this minor issue, 'Oppenheimer' stands as a testament to Nolan's vision and the cast's stellar performances. It is a thought-provoking, character-driven film that cements Nolan's status as one of today's most visionary directors.",Oppenheimer
6.0,Bizarrely entertaining,yellowsub10,22 July 2023,"This was definitely an entertaining movie but it went in so many different directions at times. Also, the product placement and clear control from Mattel takes you out of the fantasy at times. Honestly, it is unique and not something really done before, so it gets points for that. It's a lot though. Just a lot going on, and not all of what was going on was necessary.Also, Ryan Gosling is not the best singer or dancer. It was cheesy and over the top. I'm glad I saw it in theaters because if it was on a streaming service I'd probably turn it off as it was so weird. It's worth watching so you're in on the hype and pop culture reference this will surely become.",Barbie
10.0,Couldn't love it more,andrapreda,22 July 2023,"This movie is nothing like I expected AND I LOVE IT. Greta strikes again with the best combo of comedy and drama. I laughed, I almost cried and it was just the best experience.Having moments when I just loved seeing the interpretation of the Barbie world, moments that shocked me of how well they described the patriarchy even through jokes, the moments showing the women maturing and growing up that almost made me cry. There was nothing I didn't love about this movie and I can't stress this enough.Overall, this movie made me fell more empowered and confident than ever and I wish that everyone could have the same experience that I did.",Barbie
10.0,Nolan has done it again!,heinzketchup-21881,26 July 2023,"""Oppenheimer,"" directed by the visionary Christopher Nolan, is a thought-provoking cinematic journey that delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist who played a pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. With a stellar cast and exceptional storytelling, Nolan's ambitious project offers audiences an insightful look into the mind of a genius torn between moral obligations and the relentless pursuit of scientific discovery.Set against the backdrop of the tumultuous era of the 1940s, the film presents Cillian Murphy's masterful portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Murphy effortlessly captures the complexity of the man, showcasing Oppenheimer's intelligence, charisma, and unwavering passion for science. The character's inner turmoil is vividly conveyed as he grapples with the implications of his work on the atomic bomb, questioning the potential catastrophic consequences of its deployment.From the very first frame, the film's cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema takes center stage, creating a visually stunning spectacle that enhances the storytelling. The grandeur of the scientific world and the intimate struggles faced by Oppenheimer are both captured with meticulous attention to detail. The sprawling landscapes of Los Alamos and the tense laboratory scenes further immerse the audience in both the scientific genius and the moral dilemmas that haunt the protagonist.True to Nolan's signature nonlinear storytelling style, ""Oppenheimer"" weaves together key events from Oppenheimer's life in a non-chronological order. This approach adds layers of depth to the narrative, illustrating how the past, present, and future intermingle in the mind of this enigmatic figure. The director skillfully juxtaposes Oppenheimer's personal relationships, political pressures, and the weight of history to highlight their profound impact on his decisions and actions.The supporting cast delivers strong performances that complement Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer. Marion Cotillard shines as Katherine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer, the physicist's supportive yet complex wife, who provides valuable emotional insights into her husband's struggles. Michael Caine portrays Richard Tolman, Oppenheimer's trusted advisor, with gravitas and wisdom, while Kenneth Branagh brings an authoritative presence to General Leslie Groves, the military leader overseeing the Manhattan Project.While ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic triumph in many respects, its dense narrative and extensive exploration of historical events may prove challenging for some viewers to follow. The film demands an engaged and attentive audience, and casual moviegoers might find themselves overwhelmed by its intricate plot and philosophical undertones.Nolan's portrayal of the Manhattan Project, while compelling, leaves some critics desiring a deeper exploration of the ethical implications surrounding Oppenheimer's work. While the film does not shy away from addressing the moral quandaries, some argue that it could have gone further in examining the profound and far-reaching consequences of the atomic bomb.Despite these minor critiques, ""Oppenheimer"" remains a visually captivating and intellectually stimulating cinematic experience. Nolan's direction guides the audience through a complex web of historical events and personal struggles, effectively capturing the essence of Oppenheimer's brilliance and humanity.At its core, ""Oppenheimer"" raises questions about the role of scientists and their ethical responsibilities in the face of groundbreaking discoveries. It serves as a timely reminder of the potential consequences when the pursuit of knowledge is not tempered by ethical considerations.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a compelling and intellectually engaging film that offers an intimate portrait of a man who played a crucial role in shaping history. Christopher Nolan's direction, Cillian Murphy's outstanding performance, and the stunning visuals make it a must-watch for history enthusiasts and fans of thought-provoking cinema. Despite its occasional narrative complexities, the film successfully navigates the delicate balance between exploring Oppenheimer's brilliance and the ethical dilemmas that continue to resonate in our world today.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Something of a miracle,santiagofdec,25 July 2023,"Thousands of events have to conspire for a film to arrive on the screen. The craft takes a lifetime to master, the business is as tough and competitive as any in the world, hundreds of people have to meet, millions of ideas need to merge, and most films die before they're even born. So when we get a movie where such artists join at the pinnacle of their talents, in perfect timing, with the perfect story, and the perfect theme, when age and experience now allow them to give us a piece of work that is so far above and beyond the general output, craft-wise and thematically, then it deserves to be called ""something of a miracle"".A striking mastery has been delivered here by the team behind Oppenheimer. The standard of excellence is as high as it can be. The film absorbs and transports us, moves us, and terrifies us in a way only the best do, supplying the most emotional and exciting cinema experience. Nolan has become one of the most sophisticated and exciting dramatists that ever took to the big screen by extracting from such dense material many of the most suspenseful and engaging sequences put on screen. It is the most concentrated, virtuosic, and profound of his films.Most remarkable is that it manages to make an emotional epic out of minute gestures. Cillian Murphy's performance is perplexing. Every moment he creates, he encapsulates the depth and intensity of every thought pondered by its paradoxical protagonist. The real miracle of this film is that the perfect material finally met this actor to allow his potential to be revealed in its entirety. And part of what allows him to do so is the support of the most amazing ensemble of performances in recent memory; especially Robert Downey Jr's who finally shows us once and for all that he is among the most talented actors of his or any other generation.Melville wrote that ""to produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme"", but one thing is to dream of tackling such themes, another is to execute them at the visceral level that this team has. The subject matter here is so crucial that it forces us to face questions about our existence that mind-boggle even the greatest minds in the universe.",Oppenheimer
1.0,Bad Bad Barbie,justinlesteraz,23 July 2023,"This was really bad and boring. Very pandering and toxic feminine and it should have been about equality. Barbie is just not what I expected it to be. I would like if it was better and that people would save their money. Not worth it trust me, I cannot recommend.While the sets were decent, I was hoping it would end and be over soon and then I looked at my watch there was still an entire hour left.I thought about leaving and sneaking into Oppenheimer instead but alas I was with my family and they would have noticed. Just absolutely boring for both kids and adults, it should have been more about the fun Barbie Land and not so dramatic.Overall, cringe as hell and just boring while missing the mark. Men and women are equal and that is that.Good night.",Barbie
5.0,"Aggressively ""okay""",jayball98,27 July 2023,"Well, it is definetly the most capable Nolan has been writing-wise without the help of his brother.The more abstract sequences, such as Oppenheimer's recurring visions and Kitty's struggle with his affair are also welcome additions, even though they make up very little of the runtime. Actually got me wondering how Nolan would handle an erotic thriller.Unfortunately, the rest is still typical Nolan.Cold, unevenly paced with no sense of where to let the narrative breathe, dumping exposition at every opportunity, matter-of-fact filmmaking with little interest to go beyond the surface and above all, needlessly muddling with timelines so as to appear more complex. Shooting in black and white for ""Strauss's point of view"" was also completely unnecessary, as there is no other point of view or playing with an unreliable narrator, it's just the factual retelling of events, but in black and white.It is very much just a biography transferred into the medium of film, keeping focus on events instead of people, missing a lot of opportunities to emotionally engage the viewer.This might be enough for a lot of people who just like to learn about someone's life, but it absolutely isn't for me.At least the final act somewhat manages to convey a very important lesson:The line between hero and villain is always ambiguous. It all depends on where powerful people decide to put their blind spots.",Oppenheimer
1.0,GARBAGE,vinaysahrawata,24 July 2023,"Absolute TRASH, total waste of time, save your money, go watch barbie, must be way better than this one.Nolan I want my money back.Title: ""Openheimer: A Cinematic Catastrophe""I hope you don't take it personally, but ""Openheimer"" is quite possibly the most dreadful movie I've ever had the misfortune of watching. From start to finish, it was an unmitigated disaster that left me questioning the very nature of filmmaking and how this monstrosity ever saw the light of day.The plot, if one can call it that, is an incoherent mess of random scenes and inexplicable occurrences. I couldn't discern a clear storyline if my life depended on it. It felt like the filmmakers were trying to be profound and thought-provoking, but instead, they delivered a pretentious jumble of half-baked ideas that left me more confused than enlightened.The characters in ""Openheimer"" are as lifeless as a sack of potatoes. I had absolutely no emotional connection to any of them, and their motivations were about as clear as mud. It's as if the actors themselves were bewildered by the script and had no idea how to portray their poorly written roles. Watching their lackluster performances was a painful exercise in endurance.The direction and editing were so haphazard that I couldn't tell if the film was going backward or forward half the time. Jump cuts and awkward transitions were used in an attempt to be edgy, but they only succeeded in making the film feel like a choppy mess. It's evident that the filmmakers were aiming for an avant-garde approach, but instead, they achieved a level of incompetence rarely seen in cinema.The cinematography in ""Openheimer"" is nothing short of an eyesore. It's as if the director of photography had never operated a camera before and decided to experiment during the actual shoot. The result is a visual nightmare of poorly framed shots, out-of-focus scenes, and an overuse of shaky cam that made me queasy.As if the cinematic abomination wasn't enough, the soundtrack added insult to injury. The music, if you can call it that, consisted of discordant noises that assaulted my ears and made me wish for the sweet sound of silence. It felt like the composer was playing a prank on the audience, trying to see how much auditory torture we could endure before walking out of the theater.""Openheimer"" is a prime example of filmmakers trying to be ""artsy"" and ""intellectual"" without having a clue about storytelling or the craft of filmmaking. It's a slap in the face to moviegoers who expect even a modicum of coherence and entertainment value from a film. This cinematic catastrophe should be avoided at all costs, and I can't help but feel sorry for anyone involved in this embarrassing disaster, from the actors to the crew who wasted their time and talent on such an appalling project. Save yourself the agony and find something else to watch-anything else would be a step up from ""Openheimer.""",Oppenheimer
9.0,Flash weird fun that surpasses expectations.,cruise01,26 July 2023,"4.5 out of 5 stars.Barbie is a pretty good fantasy comedy film that delivers all expectations with a film being based on a beloved doll and toy brand. It is fun. It is dumb in a fun way that adults and children will love which has a story with a theme. Humor and fun characters.Margot Robbie delivers as Barbie. And along with Ryan Gosling as Ken. And rest of the cast ensemble had fun with there roles. Its a story about Barbie played by Margot Robbie who decides to leave barbieland after she has been feeling different about herself. While coming into the real world with Ken. To find out who has been playing with her doll version.Humor is a lot of fun that is entertaining in about every scene. The music soundtrack is awesome. The flashy visuals can be cheesy and knows how to be fun and not taken seriously.Overall, it is one fun summer film that everyone will enjoy.",Barbie
5.0,"I have become hype, the average of biopics",milosek,27 July 2023,"No human on the planet has a bigger cult of personality than Christopher Nolan. Not Trump, not Musk, not Messi, not Putin. No one.His fans see everything he has done as a masterpiece. It's not just that he can't do no wrong, but that he can't do no average.Yet that's exactly what this movie is. An average biopic.Advertised as a visual masterpiece, it actually makes no difference whether you watch it in IMAX or not. Facial close ups and office meetings make up for 90% of the movie. Few desert shots and a very, very brief explosion scene don't warrant the price. Nor the hype.Additionally, I'd say that the Terminator franchise presented the dangers of nuclear war far better and visually more stunning. Maybe even Stargate too.Everything presented can be expected, many common character clichés are present. The runtime is another decision driven by Nolan's ego. The score was clever at times.The spectacle is somewhat created by having a great actor fill every role, yet few are given any jobs that an average drama student couldn't fulfill.I enjoy Nolan's work, bar Tenet, which was at least ambitious. Yet Oppenheimer is just coasting on reputation.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Well this really did come as a surprise.,Sleepin_Dragon,21 July 2023,"It pains me to say it, but I enjoyed this movie so much more then I was expecting to, musical numbers, humour, there truly is something for the whole family yo enjoy.Bright, garish and somewhat kitsch, those were my expectations, and sure it's a veritable cornucopia of glitter and rainbows, but what I wasn't expecting, was for the film to be so engaging, there's actually some real depth that I wasn't expecting. That opening introduction, that came as a major surprise, and pretty much set the tone.Of course there are plenty of double entendres, laughs that adults will enjoy, kids will no doubt chuckle away too.I'm pretty sure this film is going to win awards for its production, it's very well made, creative design and visuals, a lot of thought has gone into this. Greta Gerwig did a great job.Margot Robbie is glorious as Barbie, Ryan Gosling was great I thought. The pair shared some terrific scenes, real chemistry, and plenty of cutting one liners.Great use of music, everything fitted into the film so well.8/10.",Barbie
9.0,A Bombastic Experience,ajacayen-90247,20 July 2023,"Oppenheimer is absolutely a testament as to how outstanding Christopher Nolan is in his art of filmmaking.The film is indeed an epic as it presents a story about a scientist whose fascination of the creation of atomic bombs leads to a lot of complexities not just political but even in his personal life.Oppenheimer feels similar to Studio Ghbili's The Wind Rises wherein it does deal with a man who has the love for creating something but his creation used to war. But Nolan's film takes this to a much higher degree with more comprehensive analysis on the characters, not to mention the events he went through.It is a character study and watching the film can make audience not just relate but also bewildered as to the type of man Oppenheimer is - as a scientist, outgoing political man and an ordinary man in general. It also shows the kind of leader he is in handling the project as well as the ups and downs they went through in order to make the first ever atomic bomb.Everyone in the cast was great but Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Were the best ones in the film - truly deserving of Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively.The way the production team managed to re-enact the nuclear bombs is so amazing and it's hard to believe that visual effects had nothing to do with it. Just truly insane.Oppenheimer is already ranking at the top of Christopher Nolan's career to date. With this film alongside Barbie, it is a standout film of 2023.",Oppenheimer
10.0,A masterpiece in every sense of the word.,rwdelos5517,21 July 2023,"If you somehow still didn't know Cillian Murphy before watching this film, you'll most certainly never forget him after you've finished. This man has been brilliant in every role he's performed in, but what he accomplished in this film is nothing short of perfection. Christopher Nolan remains the greatest director / filmmaker on the planet, and it's not even close. With the already incredible catalogue he's given us, this just might be his best yet. He makes a 3 hour film feel as if only half an hour has passed. The tension, the love, the scenery, the heartbreak, and the terror.....I mean, it's all there.""It's not for you. It's for them.""My heart hurts just thinking of that line.Bravo.",Oppenheimer
9.0,A complete visual treat and a masterpiece,chamaliev21,24 July 2023,"Being one of the most-fan-favorite & a promising director, Christopher Nolan has once again hit the audience with a historical masterpiece. Although Oppenheimer is much deviated from typical Nolan's style of huge scientific theories & insane plot twists, the movie had it's Nolan vibe in the screenplay, cast, background score as well as the buildup.The performance by the cast was perfect with the exceptional acting of Cillian Murphy & Robert Downey Jr which may help writing their names against an Academy Award this year. The character build up was incredible.Trinity test was one of the best scenes I've ever experienced in a movie and was a complete visual treat.Nolan seemed to has pay attention to every single detail and the movie was very well contained the story of making the atomic bomb.Anyway the dialogues with various accents were sometimes not much clear so might need a very sharp focus on the movie to understand.",Oppenheimer
1.0,I tried but I can't,rangxrang,21 July 2023,"I did have a very high expectation for this movie but.. Sorry it was the worst movie I've ever watched. I tried to find the message from this movie but I couldn't. It seems like it tried to send a message move our hearts but it wasn't delivered to audiences. Because I have no idea what exactly they wanted to make. So what did they really want to make? Musical film? Comedy? Touching stories? Girls can do anything? Or just colorful cute movies? They mixed it all and added it all so the movie became just lame and cloudy.. I hoped the movie just could be more kitschy, tacky, easy, unrealistically happy and funny like 90s, 2000s movies.I just felt sorry for Ryan Gosling and other actors and actresses.",Barbie
5.0,Hilarious with not very well thought out feminist philosophy.,mabusrd,22 July 2023,"I'll preface by saying the movie is hilarious, has a ton of iconic moments, and is definitely worth the watch.But, this is a big BUT, as a woman I think it fell flat in its feminist ideas.It basically, as usual, defined womanhood by motherhood which is a critical pitfall in my opinion, especially with a prominent cast member being a trans woman - making it a pristine opportunity to at least add a single line about women stepping away from the mother's role, and how it doesn't define our femininity or us as women.The movie also failed in showing the negative effects of patriarchy on men themselves.And while its plot contained a revolution it ended with a return to status quo, as usual for Hollywood, can't change, eh?It had a very good premise to show the negatives of both matriarchy and patriarchy, and choose to present what true equality might look like, but chose not to.It made the entire message fall flat. And since this philosophy played a big role in the plot itself, I feel like it was very disappointing.",Barbie
9.0,The movie does justice to a very complex man.,jande9,21 July 2023,"This is the first Nolan movie I've seen. He really has a way with actors as every performance is stellar. You aren't looking at the star, you're looking at the character. I am quite familiar with Oppenheimer's life and I'm not sure I would have emphasized the same aspects of his life but Nolan made his choices and the movie is very effective, but perhaps not very moving.Robert Downey Jr really stands out. He brought that character to life. Cillian Murphy did a great job portraying Oppenheimer who was such a complex character. He was in pretty well every scene surrounded by amazing actors yet he always stood out. I noticed he snuck in a few Peaky Blinder mannerisms too!I'm not sure the non-linear format was wholly successful. The progression from deeply disturbed student to brilliant but caustic professor to skilled manager of a huge collection of enormous egos to the final showdown with the lesser people he bruised on the way is confusing enough without getting it in random chunks. I was familiar with Oppenheimer's history so I could follow it, but my wife was getting a bit lost with all the characters.My wife also didn't know that the H bomb and the atomic bomb were two different things, which plays a significant role in the story, so that also added to the confusion.I saw it in 70mm regular and it looked great. The colour seemed to change depending on when the action took place, with slightly washed out images with crushed blacks in the thirties, full Technicolor in the forties and ""Color by Kodak"" in the fifties and sixties. The dialogue is sometimes a bit hard to understand though because of the strange timbre that body mics give to a voice. Maybe next time Nolan will go back to boom mics to complement his use of film.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Amazing,ColeHutton,28 July 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" may be the greatest biopic I have ever seen. Christopher Nolan has struck gold again. The film is beautiful, terrifying, and leaves you thinking after the credits roll. The acting in this film is amazing. Cillian Murphy shines in the spotlight and deserves a nod at best actor, and Robert Downey jr. Puts on one of if not the greatest performance of his career. The practical effects are stunning, and brings to life the horror of an atomic bomb. The score is masterful portraying the right themes in the perfect moments. This film needs to be seen by everyone and on the biggest screen possible.",Oppenheimer
6.0,Fun Enough,Tweetienator,22 July 2023,"Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are most charming and superb in their roles as Barbie and Ken. Also here and there are some really funny and entertaining scenes, but the ""message"" (you know all that blabla about patriarchy and matriarchy and all the cliches regarding gender from a certain point of view) drag the whole movie rather down - at least for me. For sure the movie is one great coup by the marketing team of Mattel to fit and place Barbie World into the currents of today's zeitgeist - I take any bet, the sells will rise these days profoundly. Anyway, if you are in the mood for comedy and can cope with those ""preaching elements"" you may find some entertainment (like I did), but if you are fed up with such ""progressive"" matters, you should avoid watching this one. Because of Robbie and Gosling and some fine settings and scenes this movie does not crash but Barbie is without doubt just another most hyped affair by the media, and the plot rather a very predictable one, indeed.",Barbie
9.0,An important feminist film exploring identity,AlfianKithara,23 July 2023,"Never have i seen a film on the silver screen as loud and as proud of its feminist message as Barbie. Most movies half ass it, you can put the same recycled messages that are surface level in meaning and still pander to the male audience, cause no one's gotten the guts to actually give us a film with a story and characters that's truly for women. But that's just what Greta Gerwig does. This film wonderfully balances comedy and emotion, you'll be laughing as much as you'll be crying, especially if the message of this film speaks to you. A colorful set design devoted to capture the accuracy of playing with barbie dolls, a beautiful collaboration between several female artists, empowering the film's core of exploring one's identity as a woman in a male dominated society, and the talent of the film's lead actress, Margot Robbie along with the rest of the cast ties this film together into Movie of The Century.My one critique on the film is that i find by that end of the film it was a bit too apologetic to its male characters. While it didn't diminish the film's core, I felt Barbie's message could've been amplified far more if they were less forgiving as the film shines light on the double standard placed on women, barbie doll or human.Nonetheless, this movie is simply excellent. I found myself as a trans person who has went through his own existential crisis and struggle with identity coming out the theaters extremely happy with my barbie dolls from my childhood with me. Never would i thought i would find a film that spoke to me on such a personal level as many have.",Barbie
9.0,It's very good,jacoberr,23 July 2023,"The film lasts approximately 3 hours, it is more like a Documentary. Where all the problems that arose when creating the Atomic Bomb are analyzed. The performance of Florence Pugh, Robert Downey Jr. And Cillian Murphy, among others. It has no discussion, very good actors. The R rating is for about 3 nudity sex scenes. But outside of that, it's all talk and talk. They are also suspicious of historical data that were previously secret. We hope it will be nominated for an Oscar, even though true stories are almost never awarded. People compare the Barbie Movie with Oppenheimer, when it cannot be like that, since Barbie is all fictional and its rating is PG-13, when Oppenheimer is a true story with an R rating. I recommend it to 95% to see it, it is very good. Go see it!!",Oppenheimer

Ken plays a role but it's overly complicated and annoying don't really know how this is rated as a good movie. Most like a 5/10 movie that you shouldn't watch at the cinema.Finally don't enjoy watching it at the big screen, RX and other cinematography was mid and don't look like a worth it movie to watch or invest time and money.",Barbie

I didn't think there would be a huge plot, and I was so wrong! The movie should be what every woman needs to see. Everyone in it was amazing and perfect (not Barbie perfect 😉). Had an amazing plot that made me really consider how far women have not come in life. I do love the line when a man has to ask for a job in the government and gets told he can have a much lesser job. I can not give it enough accolades. Everyone cast was perfect for their role. America Ferrera and Margot Robbie were perfection for each role!!!!Will watch again and again!",Barbie

8.0,"A brilliant film that some may find ""boring""",viktorrudik,22 July 2023,"Nolan's dialogue is always intriguing, and it is probably the best it ever was in Oppenheimer. However, heavy dialogue films may not be someone's ""Cinematic experience"", and therefore I would advise some individuals to watch the film at home.The film does it's best to make the audience understand at least the basics of what Oppenheimer is working on, however the sound mixing (as usual) sometimes overshadows the conversation, potentially leaving some audience members confused.However I was interested throughout the entire 3 hours, as a lover of cinema, the topic and the historical period, this was a pleasure to watch.",Oppenheimer
1.0,Not impressed,pdcqsq,21 July 2023,"While there were definitely some funny parts, they were too few to outweigh the other annoyingly cheesy jokes thrown around. The actors seemed a bit on the older side but the overall movie did not appear to be an ""adult movie"". I feel that it tried to find a balance for kids and adults but in the end fell short for both. Some bits were too long for my taste and the plot seemed to go back and forth too much between the Barbie and the real world. I did not have high expectations but what did help me watch through the movie were the strong messages for our generation that were heartfelt and genuine.",Barbie
3.0,Very tedious.,AndyLianB,28 July 2023,"I went in the cinema optimistic as the trailer looks really good, comedy, entertaining. But the trailer shows the only good scenes throughout the whole film, the rest I never had a bloody clue what was happening half the time, The film didn't make any sense what so ever, besides from the first 30 minutes & the dance scene which was very well performed the rest was a catastrophe.I have to praise Margot Robbie for her performance, despite the deplorable storyline, her acting was outstanding. On the other hand Ryan Gosling's acting/performance was cheap, cheesy, & overall cringeworthy. A massive shout out to Kate McKinnon her scenes were the hilariously funny, I love her originality.Overall not for me, as the storyline is atrociously written & didn't make sense.",Barbie
10.0,You don't have to love Barbies to love this movie and identify with it,starbuckmae,25 July 2023,"I'm not a Barbie fan girl in the least, but I think this has become one of those movies I will cherish. Those who were offended that they stereotyped men and made so many of them ""weak"" or ""stupid"" in this movie are seriously missing the point. They stereotyped it all (women included) in a way that was very intentional and drove home some incredibly difficult aspects of the modern human condition. They took impossibly stressful expectations that society pushes on both sexes and made them light hearted and surprisingly emotional. As a woman, even though the situations with men in the movie were exaggerated and oversimplified, they were all incredibly reflective of so many of the experiences that I and countless other women have lived through. It was nice to be seen (and to be able to laugh and cry at how on point they were)... I very rarely feel that from a movie, much less from a movie about dolls that I hardly ever chose to play with as a kid. I think the only thing I was hoping for more of was a greater acknowledgment of some less binary identities. In my opinion there were so many opportunities to more than subtlety hint at diversity there. Either way I'm pleasantly surprised at the entertaining way they tackled serious issues, how they incorporated pop culture, and how they both gave homage to the history and aesthetic of Barbie without hiding from some of the dark aspects of Mattel's past.",Barbie
7.0,Is it really the movie of the summer?,Imjustken01,24 July 2023,"I have many opinions when it comes to this movie. The movie itself was great, but as everything in life nothing is perfect.Why a 7 out of 10? You may ask yourself, well even though the movie was great produced, had a great casting, great costumes and of course an impressive set, the plot was weak. The fact that Barbie (Margot Robbie) did not last even five minutes in the Real World disappointed me. I know that she was supposed to find Gloria (America Ferrera) to get ""fixed"", so she could go home and be the stereotypical barbie again, which in fact was the main plot of the movie, at first. However, she finds her real fast, not giving Barbie enough time to get to know the Real World, aside from the disrespectful male individuals in the beginning. I would have liked Barbie to experience the Real World in a different way, even though the Real World is messed up. I think it would have been nice for Barbie to eat an ice cream for the first time that was not made of plastic or simply for Ken to feel the water at the beach and realize it was not made of plastic or foam as well.Another thing that I did not like was that some characters from Barbie Dreamhouse were not in the movie, such as Ryan, Raquelle, and Nikki, but it was better like that because we all know Raquelle and her unexplainable need to be more successful than barbie at everything. Although at some points I wonder what would have been like if Raquelle were in the movie and totally interfered with Barbie's plan of getting fixed in the Real World.Let us talk about Ken (Ryan Gosling) for a minute. I must say that, at first, I found Ryan Gosling unfit for the Ken role, but I am completely happy with the way he portrayed his character. He made me laugh so much with his facial expressions and his speeches. I went to watch the movie for Barbie and ended up in love with Ken's character. However, Ken might have been funny, but when he totally invaded Barbie's house and threw her clothes away, I found it mean and disrespectful. Yet we have never thought about the Kens for a second, like where do they go when the Barbies go to sleep.I feel like they took this movie as a huge Mattel propaganda, instead of what it should have been. A fun movie where Barbie ventures into an unknow world for the first time trying to get her ""problems"" fixed but having to bear with Ken throughout the whole trip; like those comedy movies where a duo must stick together through a difficult situation even though they do not entirely love each other's personality.At last, I loved how Barbie did not need a man to be happy or complete and I also loved how Ken realized that he didn't need Barbie for him to be Kenough. Not like in Dreamhouse where Ken is always so clingy and needy of Barbie just because. Like Barbie don't need no man to be Barbie. I also loved Allan and his awkwardness, so sad that they discontinued him and Midge. I would have liked to see Ken and Allan as buddies, after all that's why Allan was created, to be Ken's buddy, although I don't think they would have clicked.Margot did an amazing job as Barbie and so did Ryan as Ken. I love them both and loved their acting in this as well, I truly enjoyed the movie expect the little things mentioned previously.",Barbie
6.0,Creative but preachy and confusing,Imshortok06,23 July 2023,"I'm just going to get straight to the point: I liked some aspects of this movie and disliked other parts. Cinematography: awesome. Choreographed musical numbers: hilarious. Comedy: good. Margot Robbie: great. Ryan Gosling: awesome, and arguably the best part of the movie. The scenery and props really did help create the world. The storyline started off very intriguing. However, when the movie got to the meat of the plot and the central conflict, its message became confusing. It's like they wanted to make Ken the bad guy yet also sympathetic, which is not impossible or unheard of, but the way the writers did this was ineffective. Also, the resolution didn't make sense based on the message and events that led up to it. Lastly, I really hate it when movies try to empower women by dumbing down the men. I get that in a Barbie world, Ken is an afterthought, but in the real world all men were also dumb. They also treated masculine qualities as ""evil."" I hate stereotyping people, men included, and it's like all men ride horses and have fragile egos and drink ""brewskies."" And for goodness sake, if I had a dollar for every time the movie said ""patriarchy"", I'd be rich. So, overall, I give this movie a 6/10.",Barbie
10.0,So unexpected and so good.,catelynmj,21 July 2023,"I came in with no expectations and no idea of the what movie was about... and I was blown away. Under the guise of Barbie's beautiful dreamworld, the movie touches on some very real themes. With that being said, I cried multiple times throughout. The balance between social commentary and comedy was excellent, however. While it occasionally came across heavy handed, that was very much the point and very intentional. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling both do such an amazing job of portraying Barbie and Ken. I will be rewatching to soak everything in for the second time. I highly recommend for everyone to watch!",Barbie
9.0,Cinema. isn't. dead,harryjcurtis,23 July 2023,"A masterclass in film making. Nolan has been consistently creating fantastic films for years and 'Oppenheimer' is no exception. Dialogue, cinematography and pacing are all on point. Ludwig's score is a perfect match for the aesthetic of the film. I have no doubt that Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Emily Blunt and ESPECIALLY Robert Downey Jr and Cillian Murphy will all be up for awards, alongside Nolan and the movie itself. A future classic to be sure. As far as historical biopics go, a difficult and perhaps sensitive topic to tackle given its relevance today, but the messages and philosophy's shown through how the narrative is written and how history is represented throughout the movie is something I'm sure people will remember. 9/10.",Oppenheimer
10.0,"It's a marathon, but...",ringspeed,22 July 2023,"Another Nolan masterpiece telling Oppenheimer's story and interweaving 2 different moments in time. Aided by the colour and black/white to contrast the 2 stories, it means you can sit back and relax, and marvel in what is an amazing piece of cinema.Cillian Murphy has the gong in the bag already but so does Nolan surely. The storytelling, direction, attention to detail, cinematography, it's all 10/10.Criticisms? None, only a realisation that I should've brushed up more on history before watching, particularly when you realise there's a whole 3rd act still to go after the bomb is dropped.You know you've been in a marathon when you leave the cinema, but you also know you've witnessed something pretty amazing.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Barbie is not a simple live action of a timeless doll,nethy-nho,23 July 2023,"But it is also in its smallest details, from the art direction, costumes, and any technical choice completely thought of referencing all Barbie generations and the like. A soundtrack that will take you from laughing to crying (yes, very musical moments, after all it is a Barbie movie), in addition to the hand-picked cast, Margot is impeccable and manages to express all her feelings, just with her eyes. Greta's direction and screenplay, just amazing, strong, emotional, empowering and very, very feminist, not only for the women who are already fighting for the cause, but to open everyone's eyes to a sisterhood.",Barbie
10.0,Masterpiece,stridebertie,22 July 2023,"Biopics are often well presented and offer a deep storyline to keep you immersed. Nolan rightly chose to work on this film as I believe it's the best film I've ever seen. I'm lost for words when asked to describe my experience and thought of this film and I often resort to simple vocabulary like ""it was amazing"" or ""I loved it"" and not many people will recognise what I truly mean by that. Oppenheimer, directed by Christopher Nolan is a story based solely around J. Robert Oppenheimer, a Quantum Physicist who played a large role in the development of the atomic bomb. The film explores his life, his work and it is all presented through his eyes.",Oppenheimer
6.0,The Lego Movie but for females,masontullis,22 July 2023,Now please take into consideration that I am a man. And a white man at that.Barbie was much better than I thought it was going to be. I'm just going to get into what I didn't like. Barbie starts off as a fun light hearted comedy movie. The first 30 mins are great! From then on the movie begins to have an identity crisis. It goes from deep feminist themes to a car commercial to a slide show to a 4th wall break depression Barbie ad and then a musical. One of my biggest problems was that I felt like the movie was talking to the audience too much. Things were being said or done visually in the movie not for the sake of the story but for the audience. Which maybe some people like but to me it kinda took me out of the experience.Barbie wanted to be taken seriously but because of its inability to be consistent and justify the actions of certain characters and events it left the audience behind.Like what is the purpose of Mr. Buisness(Will Ferrall)? Is he good? Is he evil? Does he care? Does he just want money? Why does he ask like a Barbie but he's from the real world?At the end of the day I agree with a lot of what was being said and the themes that were built. I just don't think the movie is for me... at all. But I didn't hate it and Ryan Gosling gets a 💯/10.,Barbie
1.0,Advertising Campaign,keithlinstead,27 July 2023,"I take it the sales of Barbie and Ken have plummeted over the last few years. This isn't a movie, it's an advertising campaign. Fair play to all involved, the movie actors and producers and the manufacturer will make a fortune. But as a movie, this is utter garbage, no real substance to the plot and the way the film has been written is a shambles. If the writers are on strike in Hollywood we should all be grateful for the respite. Hopefully whilst they are on strike they can come up with some substantial plots and decent writing. When the unjustified hype calms down this will be remembered for being awful.",Barbie
10.0,Watch this!,poemanja,26 July 2023,"""I'm just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so that people will like us. And if all of that is also true for a doll...""Bro I was so excited just to look at the beautiful painted sets and watch the beautiful Barbies and Kens wear goofy clothes...but this was a deep movie.The seemingly perfect matriarchal world of Barbie has has a sudden setback when the perfectly Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie)'s heels land flatly on the ground.Barbie has to leave Barbieland through a surreal theatrical series of vehicles to wind up in California, where she meets her creators at Mattel and others.Of course Mattel, one of the producers, wanted to paint themselves in a positive light. They probably over-emphasize their importance in the playroom (They assert Barbie was the first doll to not be a baby doll, the first opportunity little girls had to play at being something other than a mother, which I find hard to believe). But there is definitely some honest criticism in the movie of who Barbie is and what she represents. Does Barbie make women feel bad about their bodies? Maybe.There are also a couple very playful moments where it feels almost like it feels when one plays with toys. Made me think of the Lego Movie (Which also had Will Ferrell in it).Then there's the characters. There is humor. There is music. There are of, course, gorgeous people and sets. But most of all, there is self-actualization and growth.I love every line in this film. I keep thinking about it. I've seen the movie twice now and I hope to see it again. Please watch it. Prepare to cry.",Barbie
6.0,"Loved The Barbie Doll As A kid, Loved The Barbie Movie As An Adult",SAMTHEBESTEST,21 July 2023,"Barbie (2023) : Movie Review -Barbie Review: Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie is a breezy, funny, pinky, and girly Ride Into Barbieland. These four soft adjectives are enough to describe the Barbie movie. Greta Gerwig takes us into Barbie land with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling to deliver a possible fantasy that we all dreamed of as children or as adults. Being a boy, I couldn't have a Barbie doll in my childhood, but I did have a close look at her with my female cousins playing with her, doing make-up, dress-up, and all the girly stuff. And I don't think any boy is unaware of Barbie and Ken, even if he hasn't played with them in childhood. It's a fascination for us and a dream come true for girls. I am not at all hesitant to admit that if I were a girl, I would have enjoyed this movie more than I actually did as a boy. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it, and that's more than enough for today's social media gender ego system.Barbie begins with the inception of Barbie and how she appeared on earth (if we call it that in this fantasy movie). This very scene is a lot of fun when you see Margot Robbie appearing in black and white checks in one piece and little girls breaking their dolls into pieces. Soon, we are transported into Barbie Land, where all Barbies are living happily. All the women are self-confident, working in top positions, successful, and enjoying life to the fullest, while all Kens are jobless and do nothing but try to mingle with barbies. Our stereotypical Barbie (Robbie) suddenly begins to dysfunction and sense the morality of human life. She has to travel to the human world to find out who the child is who is calling her to be there. Obviously, Ken (Gosling) forces his company on her. However, things go wrong for Barbie in the real world, where she realises she is not loved anymore, whereas Ken finds a motto of patriarchy. Ken returns and takes over Barbieland by persuading other Kens and brainwashing the rest of the babies there. Here, distraught Barbie finds Gloria (America Ferrera), a Mattel employee, who is the catalyst of her existential crisis. Gloria began playing with her daughter Sasha's (Ariana Greenblatt) Barbie toys while experiencing her own identity crisis, inadvertently transferring her concerns to Stereotypical Barbie. Gloria restores Barbie, and then they take off on a mission to bring back all Barbies.It's been a while since we have seen a good-budget comedy movie, so Barbie certainly ends the dry spell. I mean, this one is a fun ride from start to end. It may be a little childish-oh, that's a bad word-let's say child-friendly, but it's damn funny. The humour is girlish, yes, but I liked it too. From Zack Snyder, The Godfather, cautionary note on Margot's casting to slapstick one-liners, Barbie is such a colourful comedy. It does not look like an intelligent film; rather, it stages itself as a crazy comedy. That's one of the points I'd say went wrong in the climax. These characters aren't supposed to be smart, but they intend to be when it comes to ending the show. Why? Pixar's Toy Story had the simple but subtle philosophy that a toy should be a toy for a lifetime. It may have many owners, but its job is to stick to them and be loyal, because that's why we humans love them. Barbie challenges this universally accepted theory and goes against the tide. Now, whether it's good or bad, I leave that choice to you since my personal opinion isn't very affirmative about this theory.Barbie was meant to be a career-defining role for Margot Robbie, and she made sure that you'd remember her forever as Barbie. I kept looking for a single frame where she would not look pretty, and I couldn't find it for 110 minutes. I melted, man. Ryan Gosling's Ken is the funniest character in the whole movie. That cute flirting, those reluctant expressions, jealousy, arrogance, and at last self-discovery-this man has lived the character. Kate McKinnon's weird Barbie appears for a short time but serves enough. Other babies, including Issa Rae, Hari Nef, Alexandra Shipp, Emma Mackay, Dua Lipa, Sharon Rooney, Ana Cruz Kayne, Ritu Arya, and Nicola Coughlan, are all gorgeous. On the other hand, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Scott Evans, Simu Liu, Rob Brydon, Ncuti Gatwa, and John Cena as Kens add fine support. Michael Cera, Ariana Greenblatt, and Will Ferrell pass the time well, while Rhea Perlman's cameo is blasting. The biggest cheer in the Barbie movie came for America Ferrera's monologue, which describes the struggle and victory of feminism. Ariana Greenblatt steals the show in the first, and the rest of the cast has done well.Made on a budget of $145 million, Barbie is a lavish big screen entertainer, as the production design makes sure you feel the fantasy right. Those fakish items could have been excluded, but having them there is kind of fun in itself. Who's to blame? Rodrigo Prieto's camera does the talking with close-ups and long shots of Barbie and Ken. Barbie does not have any loo breaks, courtesy of Nick Houy's superb editing, and the music is lovable. Some people often say that a female director and female lead's pair is something else, and I have to accept that Barbie could have been a lot less underwhelming without Greta Gerwig. This woman has made a world that is so adorable and so rummy. A few flaws are there in the script and the characters, but since we are not discussing an artistic masterpiece of cinema, let's Chuck that discussion. Let's enjoy this pinky and girly entertainer, which is sure to take female audiences by storm and leave a good enough impact on men too. Not to forget, who's writing it.RATING - 6/10*",Barbie
10.0,Amazing cinematic experience,nasserabdulrahman,21 July 2023,"I went to the movies to see what's the hype is all about. At first I already knew that the movie would be phenomenal because it's directed by Christopher Nolan but my God did the movie exceed my expectations, especially in the cinematography, sound effects, and the direction that the directors had from the movie, and seeing how Cillian Murphy impersonated Robert Oppenheimer in the best way an actor should be. And I had a lot of fun experiencing this movie, especially in IMAX thank you Christopher Nolan for this masterpiece. I know I'm not a movie critic or anything but if you enjoy movies and love the cinemas, I highly recommend Oppenheimer.",Oppenheimer
9.0,A hysterically funny and clever triumph from Gerwig,bastille-852-731547,23 July 2023,"In the hands of another filmmaker, a ""Barbie"" film could have been a bland or soulless cash-grab just seemingly made to sell more of the iconic Mattel doll. But cinephiles know that Greta Gerwig's short-but-no-less-impressive track record of writing and directing is nothing short of superb, having made two outstanding films (2017's ""Lady Bird"" and 2019's ""Little Women."") Gerwig's films are always rooted in deep emotional affection and a profound understanding of womanhood with a level of emotional authenticity rarely seen in major Hollywood films. These levels of depth in her films are complemented by exceptionally clever and often funny writing. Needless to say, her take on ""Barbie"" is exceptional and certainly lives up to the seemingly earth-shattering hype. Gerwig and Baumbach's satirical screenplay is consistently hilarious from beginning to end, while depicting and analyzing themes related to feminism in a thoughtful and profound way. The film brilliantly threads the needle between being summer popcorn entertainment and being something far more original, creative, insightful, and clever than simply just that. The film's jokes come rapid-fire and are consistently hilarious in an intelligent way, even also poking fun at plenty of pop culture and film-related references that cinephiles will adore.The consistently entertaining and uproarious script is made more impactful by great performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, who are both absolutely joys to watch as Barbie and Ken, respectively. The supporting cast is great too, with standouts being Kate McKinnon and America Ferrera. Another standout of the film is the superb production design and associated aesthetic qualities of Barbie Land, which is absolutely stunning to look at visually. While the film's tone is often comedic (which is great, given how clever and funny it is,) its more serious themes are still handled very sensitively, including a very powerful monologue from America Ferrera and an emotionally engaging resolution to the story. Sharp, incisive, original, and fun, ""Barbie"" is an outstanding movie that audiences will remember long after the credits roll, and I truly can't wait for Gerwig's next film. 9.5/10.",Barbie
7.0,Slow But Sparkling,shanemessman,26 July 2023,A lot big rereleases this summer. This being one of the huge duw to its critics following. Directed by one of Hollywood's high class directors Mr. Christopher Nolan. Firstly the biography of the scientist is very well portrayed with factual history. In my opinion there could have been more entertainment factors added to engage the audience more. The movie is 3 hours long in length which does make it seem VERY slow. Half the audience were asleep. The beauty of Nolan is he doesn't make it seem that there are any unnecessary scenes in the movie it feels required. The acting performances are excellent. Main lead by Cillian murphy he has also appeared in Mr. Nolans previous hits in smaller roles but now I feel he got the deserving role. His body language and expressions as oppeheimer are fantastic: Living the character. Following other big names too like R. D. J with a good performance too as an antagonist. Now the best part about the movie is the sparkling cinematography which lead the audience eyes shining. I watched this in Imax 70 MM on the best screen possible so I cant talk about the regular but Im sure it still shows. Its worth taking 70 MM from what I saw. The other good thing was the sound design also exceptional. Makes you feel your in the movie. Everytime there is a bomb the audience gets a jumps care. The whole audience in my theatre didint say a word for the whole movie even though it was a full house no seats available (even though it was a weekday). Overall a Slow but sparkling watch for the fans!,Oppenheimer
10.0,Future Classic,joshuarj-53022,25 July 2023,"This movie will become a classic. I watched this movie in theaters and it will certainly take a while to process. Its essentially a biography of Oppenheimer's life, but with a focus on the period around the manhattan project. It was truly a very ponderous movie that presents many moral questions, especially pertaining to the the atomic bomb. The inclusion of practical effects by Christopher Nolan added levels of realism and immersion that left me feeling like I was really at the trinity test. I left the theater astounded. My only strife might be that the short nudity and sex scenes didn't really add much to the story. Overall an exceptional film.",Oppenheimer
3.0,What a waste of three hours,eli-691-131264,24 July 2023,"I didn't like this movie.There was too little theory to call it interesting or science popularisation - something I really liked in Interstellar.There was a number of factual mistakes, actually unacceptable for a historic movie.There was background music throughout the entire film, which gave it a dramatic effect. Though, to my taste - if you get to the point to require music to give the dramatic effect, your story is weak.There was this nonsensical timeline back and forth, where the most recent time was shot, for whatever reason, in black and white - I don't even care why, I just didn't like the the timeline hops.Ultimately and most severely, the glorification of making and using a mass killing bomb - regardless of the intentions of the creators, philosophical dilemmas that haunt them later, catchy lines thrown around by literally everyone in the film - is atrocious and barbaric.Especially during the scene of preparation for the final test, I would like Nolan to show the peaceful citizens of Hiroshima, who didn't know that their days were last, and nothing that they did actually mattered, because they would've been blown up by these scientists.Overall: Terrible story, bad visuals, decent play by a load of very strong actors, distracting music, too much of Cillian Murphy closeups, factual errors, no moral balance.I wish I hadn't spent time I watching this.",Oppenheimer
7.0,"Difficult to digest, even after reading ""American Prometheus""",deweybidwell,26 July 2023,"Make no mistake, Christopher Nolan is a brilliant filmmaker. While reading the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin, I felt that the narrative bogged down a bit in the forensic historiography of Oppenheimer's unfortunate excursions into left wing political politics during WW2 and the resultant McCarthyesque fallout after the dropping of the bomb. I feel that Mr. Nolan got caught in that same bog, and the film suffers a bit as a result. The rest of the film is brilliant, and might have come in better at the 160 minute mark. The dialogue in the first half was also unfortunately blared out by the soundtrack. I saw it in XD. A good watch for history buffs interested in the beginnings of the Cold War.",Oppenheimer
4.0,Such a lag,pratyprat,23 July 2023,"This movie is about women and how they are suppressed in the real world. The concept is good but the way they portrayed it is straight up boring in the film. Greta gerwig did not live up to her full potential while making this film. The first half of the film was fun and had a bit of humour . Anything after the first half was just a stretch. Anyone going to watch the movie in the theatre I would suggest you guys not go just wait for the ott release. If someone even wants to go ,go for the hype not to expect anything from it . Well only reason I even gave a four star was because i can't imagine anyone else playing the role of barbie and ken( Margot robbie and Ryan Gosling) they were great.",Barbie
10.0,"Oppenheimer, Nolan's masterpiece!",EduardoRoglin,29 July 2023,"This is cinema! For me, this is Nolan's most impactful masterpiece. It is without a doubt the best adaptation of a book I have ever seen. The story is portrayed in an incredible, tense and dynamic way. I like the fact that it is dynamic because it manages to hold the viewer well even in moments that would be calmer or even a little boring in other stories, but here everything is done very well for you to hold. One thing that helps to keep you hooked is the incredible interpretation of the actors, giving life and high realism to their characters and I especially highlight Cillian Murphy who is the soul of Oppenheimer. The film manages to convey the feeling of the scene very well, especially seconds before the explosion, making us feel in the protagonist's shoes and what helps is the fact that Nolan has not used any CGI the whole film, so it makes us anxious for the result as well as Oppenheimer and his co-workers.",Oppenheimer
7.0,A fun movie with a political agenda,mydogjustdied,20 July 2023,"Barbie is a really fun movie that sets itself up with a lighthearted premise. The humor is self aware, the set design is immaculate, the actors are perfect for their roles. But eventually it turns itself into a feminist commentary on the patriarchy. This by itself isn't horrible, it's just quite heavy handed. I understand why they did it, Barbie as a concept has seen controversy in recent years and it would've sparked more controversy if they made a movie completely blind to it and not addressing it at all. But it's just.. not what you're looking for when you go see a Barbie film. In fairness, if they went the other route by simply nostalgia bating, I'm sure people would've called it hollow, money grabbing and meaningless. There's no way this movie could ever satisfy everyone. Personally I think the movie would've been better with a tad less social commentary and more focus on the whimsical storyline. Other than that, no qualms about the execution. This is still a really fun movie if you can handle a little political pandering.",Barbie
10.0,Aww inspiring and scary as hell!,kingfisherwest,25 July 2023,"3 hours of breathtaking cinema. Ignore the criticisms around the sound, or the length of the film. This is a masterful cinematic experience. It's packed with stars who all play their part, most of them understated but all helping to move this 'movie of 3 parts' forward.If Cillian Murphy doesn't win the Oscar for this performance then there is truly no justice. His stoic, understated performance is best in class. Amazing.Nolan once again blows me away and I loved it.Lastly, if the central theme doesn't scare the hell out of you then gos help us all!! When the move ended, there was silence in the cinema for 5 minutes. Not a sound. Just contemplation around what was unleashed at Los Alamos.",Oppenheimer
10.0,I already need to see it again!,rlabraaten,25 July 2023,"It was nostalgic, hilarious, esthetically orgasmic and very moving. It covered all generations of Barbie, which was my hands down favorite toy as a kid. It also touched on the female experience in a really welcoming, wonderful way. I felt it included aspects of the male experience that are important as well. Awesome soundtrack, AMAZING SETS, and wardrobes. The cast was amazing, the writing was perfect, such an original, unique stroy line. If you're going to criticize this movie for going ""against your political beliefs"" then you don't deserve this movie anyways. Women are allowed to talk about the female experience and Barbie was a great way to do it! I just saw it 2 days ago and I really want to see it again!!",Barbie
9.0,Exceeds Expectations,asayed-63121,23 July 2023,"If you told me a few years ago that one of the best movies in 2023, and arguably the highest-grossing one is going to be Barbie, I would have laughed and called you crazy. But here we are, and the atmosphere in the theatre felt like a cultural revolution, which can become ""You just had to be there"" moment for the Gen-Zs.Through the medium of this film, Greta Gerwig expresses the frustrations of all women, and at the same time presents a satirical take on patriarchy. The movie praises Barbie for being a feminist icon, but at the same acknowledges it's regressiveness. Ken is basically every man who embodies patriarchal ideals just for being rejected, as he feels accepted in the real world but gets ignored in the Barbieland, which was a stark reflection on how women feel in the real world. At the end, it has a beautiful message for all women.The script is genuinely funny with bucket-load of hilarious moments and lines. Ryan Gosling brings his A-game as Ken, saying that his expressions are hilarious would be an understatement. Ryan has basically understood the assignment. Margot Robbie was basically born to play the role of Barbie, as she fits into the role to a T. You can feel her as she is going through an existential crisis.The set-design and costumes were praiseworthy and clearly deserves an Oscar nod. The costumes of each Barbies and Kens have been designed so beautifully and intricately, that it bears a mention. The buildings in Barbieland have also been created with love and passion for the universe. The architecture of the movie is a visual treat for the audience.The cinematography of the film does a good job of presenting the Barbie with glitz and glitter. It is pink and completely unapologetic about it.The soundtrack is an icing on the cake. 'I am just Ken' is still stuck on my mind, as I am penning down this review. However, I do feel that the supporting cast was wasted, as thsy had very little to do.In conclusion, the movie is a popcorn-muncher but at the same time delivers a heartfelt message which is very important for the world.",Barbie
5.0,Just ok - end falls flat,jerankin1,21 July 2023,"Although the Barbie movie's funny bits were good for one viewing, and there were several funny bits throughout the film, I think the writer/director wrote herself into a corner so the ending just falls flat. The parodies were funny, and the contrasts with real life were funny, but the writers just didn't know where to go with the story in the end. A lot of Greta Gerwig's films are like that. Disappointing. I wouldn't see the Barbie movie more than once, which is sad, because I've seen Dial of Destiny four times, and I am going back for a fifth viewing. That film did not disappoint! This one could have been a lot better.",Barbie
10.0,So Much Fun,CampsieNP,24 July 2023,"I completely enjoyed Greta Gerwig's outstanding movie Barbie. It was delightful to see on the big screen with the great soundtrack and the eye-popping colors. Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie and she made a great movie even better.Someone asked why a 60+ adult female like me would go to see this kids movie.For me, Barbie was such a huge part of my childhood. Playing ""Barbs"" with my best friend as a young girl is one of my most cherished memories. It was something just for girls when we were mostly excluded from being in any lead role in the world (our moms, aunts, grandma's were excluded too). No sports, few female leads in film or television, few jobs outside of the pink collar ghetto we were kept in. Barbie was beautiful and the center of her own story. For this reason I had to go on opening weekend to vote for the world of Barbie, to say, thank you.",Barbie
10.0,Magnificent cinematography,ellysimeonova,21 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan is a genius on the level of Spielberg and Scorsese. The best anti-war film since Hair and Apocalypse Now. Brilliant Cillian Murphy, Robert Dawney Jr, Emily Blunt and Mat Damon, magnificent acting from all the actors, brilliant direction by Christopher Nolan. Perfect cinematography. Extremely good visual effects. There is not even one thing that irritates you A politically incorrect, stunning. You are speechless after the movie ends. I didn't think Hollywood could make such a worthwhile movie anymore. Will definitely watch it again. It might be the best movie made in the 21st century and hope it's not the last one!",Oppenheimer
2.0,Waste of time,sanashakib,23 July 2023,"If ur over 13 this movie will most definitely bore you. The movie tried so hard to make a point yet still failed.The cast was amazing but the plot didn't do much I see how the writers tried to make the movie show us the double standards when it comes to woman rights but honestly they did such a bad job at that. I really hoped this movie would actually be as meaningful as the writers intended it to be but it was just a very bad comedy.a very bad representation of woman and just overall a bad movie.It could be fun for passing time and for girls night, but don't expect to be amazed by it.cause you will be disappointed.",Barbie
9.0,Nolan's Masterpiece??,jydtfhbv,23 July 2023,"This was my highest anticipated movie of the year and it absolutely met my expectations. Long runtime, but to me, it didn't feel like it dragged at all due to the fast pacing of the movie. Movie should be nominated for several awards including best actor, supporting actor, cinematography, score, director and film. Do not go into this expecting a typical Christopher Nolan film like the dark knight or inception, this is telling the story of Oppenheimer and his life and development of the bomb. But for a movie with no action at all, I felt gripped from beginning to end and that's why Nolan is showing that he's one of the best directors to do it. And when the bomb drops.....oh wow, the tension was through the roof! A lot of reviews have been stating ""most important film of the decade"" they may be right. This and the Dark Knight, are my two favorite Nolan films, but this may be his defining masterpiece.",Oppenheimer
3.0,As heavy handed as a movie can be,jackgdemoss,27 July 2023,"Barbie was a huge surprise in both a positive and negative way. On the upside, I was not expecting as many solid comedy moments and stellar performances by Gosling and Robbie. I was expecting the PG-13 rating to be a bit more for show but it is used to good comedic effect on a number of occasions.The biggest surprise was how effective the marketing team behind this film was. They were not only able to elevate initial hype by tying themselves to a Nolan film, but they were also able to completely disguise what the film was about. Trailers would lead you to believe this will be a fun-loving comedy with some character moments, some heart, and a lot of nostalgia. Instead, Barbie's central theme and main plot revolve around the least nuanced take on feminism I have seen to date. I would not be surprised if this script was made by having a 10 year old girl describe the basics of patriachry to an AI, specify that it should make an over-exaggerated mean spirited narrative from it, and then have some of the most unintelligent writers in hollywood tack on a monologue for the human character at the end. That final monologue by the mother is one of the most insufferable things I have experienced in a movie theater.",Barbie
6.0,Don't expect traditional Nolan thrills,rdowd93,23 July 2023,"Oppenheimer is very much a beautifully shot, edited and scored achievement in filmmaking. However, this movie, either by design or unintentionally is not as gripping or thrilling as other Nolan movies. Perhaps, the audience should have expected this given that it was marketed as a biopic. But, still, with Nolan at the helm, I expected more suspense. The stakes of the Manhattan project were existential, yet that feeling of existentialism was lacking throughout the film. Cillian Murphy's performance was masterful, but I don't feel that I learned anything of substance about the subject he was portraying.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Amazing film!,jrbsalvado,26 July 2023,"This film is a masterpiece of Christopher Nolan.The paradox of the invention of the Atomic bomb is incredible and we can see this over the entire film.The role that Cillian Murphy played was perfect and we can see both happiness and sadness in the caracther along the movie, it deserves a Oscar award.The sound and the images in general of the film was really Nolans work, the caracthers of the movie were with a very good image.This film is all about Oppenheimer and the other caracthers are just like a accessory of the film, just his wife and strauss have a little more development.In general a great movie!",Oppenheimer
1.0,Rubbish movie don't waste your time,amandakelly-44326,21 July 2023,"The only good things about this movie were the actors. Felt like I was watching one big commercial for Barbie constantly plugging outfits and what Barbie really means for young girls, I guess it was produced by Mattel which says a lot.I was hoping for something smart and satirical like the Lego Movie but this was just a silly story with dumb humour.The nostalgia is the draw card for people (including me) I loved Barbie growing up but it wasn't enough for me to enjoy this.Dont waste your time, the producers spent more on the advertising and promo work than they did getting a good story together.",Barbie
8.0,One of the Best Comedies Released in the Last Few Years,nnatti,22 July 2023,"I went to see Barbie with the highest of expectations and it did not disappoint.At times the whole movie theatre was laughing out loud. It was a beautiful experience to share. And there was even clapping at the end.It does not matter if you are young or old, a man or a woman, this is a movie you will enjoy.Do yourself a favor: leave your judgements aside and go watch it.Brief disclaimer: it is Barbie. It does touch on some controversial issues; considering Barbie always has been a female stereotype. It touches on the place of the woman in the world, the patriarchy, etcetera. I was not prepared for that and I do have some strong personal opinions on the topic itself. That being said: everything was so beautifully done and told and funny I seriously cannot complain about it. I honestly really enjoyed it.",Barbie
8.0,The emotions of a man who pulled the biggest trigger after Lord Krishna,rsashik,24 July 2023,"I'm a physicist and I watched this movie in IMAX (which made a slight difference) after doing my homework. I saw exactly what I expected which was unusual in itself for a Nolan's film. The movie is set at a period when philosophy mattered as much as physics for a scientist. The movie is all about one person who sees the world around him differently. This visionary genius is now under the terrible predicament of finding the most horrible weapon for the greater good which also happens to be his passion, nuclear fission. The same predicament which Krishna put himself under to instigate destruction. Sadly, he is also put on trial for his exact achievement later. So, He has to bare the cross and get crucified for it! Cillian Murphy recreated Oppenheimer like a magician. The tempo of the movie along with its wave-natured background score using it to pump your adrenaline at key moments. Unfortunately, it got to me in the last 30 minutes at which point I felt the movie is starting to get uninteresting. Overall, a must watch for Cillian Murphy.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Oppenheimer - Beautifully terrifying Masterpiece,gotaskar,23 July 2023,"Probably the only director of our times whose name is enough to pull the crowd to theaters. His best quality is that he thinks that the audience is smart enough to understand and doesn't spoon feed everything.Oppenheimer is a biographical thriller which makes Nolan sit in another league of filmmakers. His Nolan ness is stamped in every scene. Caution - don't expect action or masala entertainment here, it's a very serious study of the character of the father of the atomic bomb.Every time I see a biopic I want to go into the psyche of the protagonist but only a handful of movies were successful in doing that, and this is one of them. From the first frame till the last one you are with Oppenheimer, Nolan grabs you by neck and puts it into the mind of the character. His struggles, his inner turmoil, his guilt you feel it in every frame. This was also possible because of Cillian Murphy, It will be his career defining role. He has just become Oppenheimer. In some of the scenes his acting chops are just masterclass.Casting is done so perfectly that you cannot imagine any other actor in that role. RDJ makes worthy as a opponent to Cillian Murphys character. His brilliance overshadows his persona. Mat Damon, Emily Blunt, Cassey Affleck, Gary Oldman every one is brilliant in their portrayal. This is Nolan's legacy that great actor's have agreed to appear for one or two scenes just to be associated with Nolan and trust on his filmaking. Everyone has given their best.Music by Ludwig Göransson is special, it perfectly fits the scenes and makes the movie more immersive. Although I felt the Hans Zimmer mark on it. Cinematography, editing, production design, writing you name it every department has given their best to this project. Highlights are 2 sequences the detonation of the bomb and the gym speech sequence. This is the most refined film making you will get. Hats of to his vision and guts to not to use CGI. But still managing to get emotions out of you.We in India had something similar to this, the story of Nambi Narayanan. R Madhavan tried his best to make his directorial debut from this story but it felt short on a lot of levels. If you really want to compare, then compare The Nambi effect with Oppenheimer, you will know how much behind we are than Hollywood.For me by far this is Nolan's best as pure film making point of view. It's 3 hours long, dialogue and conversation heavy but the way it is paced you won't feel the length. But it doesn't have the same re-watchable quality like his other movies. It's not for everyone, normal film audience will be bored. But it's a feast for cinephiles like me. It stunns you with his craft. More power to Nolan. It's an Oscar studded movie, by far the best film of the year. Thank you for this and as always eagerly waiting for your next.#Oppenheimer #oppenheimermovie #moviereview #Oppenheimerreview.",Oppenheimer
7.0,"Good Cinematography, Discombobulated Story",xgrcx,22 July 2023,"By no means is Oppenheimer a bad film - in fact I would recommend anyone looking for an experience to go check it out. However I do believe the film is a bit unorganized and is largely saved by good performances and great cinematography, at least up until the last one-half to one-third. After that, the story takes a more ""traditional"" route and cleans everything up nicely, barring a few things which I wish were done differently.Again. I highly recommend this film to anyone who is looking for an alternative and perhaps a bit more ""high roller"" drama in the same category as ""The Theory of Everything"" / ""Goodwill Hunting"" / "" A Beautiful Mind""",Oppenheimer

But if you sit back and think it as a Biopic and the struggles which Oppenheimer had in his life you will realise the film made full justice to his character and his story.....apart from controversial statement of bringing Bhagwat Gita phrase ....the film has done no wrong .....Brilliant Story Telling .... Yes the first half was long and Boring but it had to be ........ 2nd half was so fast paced and answers lot of questions.......Wait for last 20 seconds it will create goosebumps......I give 9/10 for this Epic ......",Oppenheimer
8.0,Very good film,alfiegriffiths-35249,23 July 2023,Very good felt like it dragged a but at the end for me which brings the marks down. But overall a very good film with good and enjoyable characters and plot line. Good aspects of comedy in some moments with a good soundtrack to partner with the film. I enjoyed the scenes in barbie land the most but that's not to say the scenes in the real world weren't enjoyable. It wasn't what I expected it to be in a good way. It clearly didn't have a mainly child audience which made it a lot more enjoyable. I loved watching how barbie and Ken adapted to the real world compared to barbie land and how mainly reacted to things that she can't do in barbie land like drinking.,Barbie
9.0,Great satire on present day society,samaunga-68409,26 July 2023,Gets you a typical Hollywood movie which feels good to watch but provokes you to think it helps you decide whether you want to be just influenced by the world around you the media the news and the industry which is grabbing your attention or do you want to accept that you are a human being with needs and wants and not just a piece of toy to be manipulated by the media.It begins with a simile of everybody's life that is Barbie land it is kind of our own sweet world which every human being prefers to live into rather than entering into the race of humans into the workforce and do the society etc and their Barbie and can reflect upon how different the real world can be from the world they're used to kind of like what happens to people of every kind I think this is a super movie too provoking people to think are they living to please the world around them or are they just living to live.,Barbie
4.0,Writers were lost with this one,kerembaser-08974,23 July 2023,"If you want to educate yourself on patriarchy, read Virginia Woolf. The creation or viewing of this movie are horrible ways to raise your awareness about women's rights. It feels like writers were out of ideas an hour into the movie. The movie tries to have some sense of humor but hurts the main idea more than defending it while trying to make jokes about stereotypes of today.The movie features musical type scenes but both the songs and dancing is horrible. People discuss if barbie products inspire girls or force a certain body type to them, so disappointing them but no worries, this movie can inspire nor deceive no one. Even the director lost inspiration half way through.",Barbie
9.0,I was just speechless,shizofreninja,20 July 2023,"The movie is impeccable. The explosion scene was so beautiful and terrifying so I couldn't even breathe. Cast's effort is just perfect, director's effort is glorious and great. Christopher Nolan is the best director of modern cinema, only few can be with him on the same stage. Cillian Murphy must have his Oscar for this, it was just perfect. The most thrilling and beautiful moment was in the end, when whole audience just started the applause. I will never forget this movie and this IMAX experience. I highly recommend EVERYONE to watch it in IMAX, drive somewhere, If you don't have IMAX in your town.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Was way more than I expected,yxzgjnydf,20 July 2023,"Went to the Wednesday Barbie Blow Out showing - I went into it thinking it was going to be a cute charming movie. It wasn't anything I expected, I've never seen a movie like this before, on all levels from writing, the sets. Every actor has such amazing range. The way each scene transformed your mind set, having you want more. This movie was so good It was written with current, real issues while also being nostalgic and filled with Easter eggs, while giving ode to the past and so self aware. The writers and actors perfectly put into a scene the struggles, heartache, dissonance into everyday life, while making you cry of both laughter and sadness.",Barbie
1.0,Taking down the human thinking standards,rahulpoonia-55897,23 July 2023,"Barbie is not carrying any knowledgeable and intelligent thing but carrying a lot of pink color.Movie shows anything but the talent of a director, writer, actor, actress.This shows which kind of knowledge and information standard we are passing to our next generation.Just for the sake of upcoming generation we should not create a legacy in the entertainment industry like 'Barbie'.Honestly this movie is a total reflection of comic fantasy nothing to do with the logic and the reality.Entertainment is not only about showing pink color this should be carry something valuable and the women's suffering as Barbie is trying to depict is already treated so we have to move to the next level and should try to depict more deepen level women suffering besides the body shaming thing because most of the world have been overcome this type of mentality already.",Barbie
10.0,I'm gonna keep it super simple. This is cinema.,maukaroni,26 July 2023,"10/10. Gripping, suspenseful and surprisingly intimate. Great casting, even better performances, superb dialogue, and fantastic story telling. Cilian Murphy, Robert Downey, and even Gary Oldman (as short as his time was in the film) deserve Oscar nominations at the very least. Emily blunt was also amazing. This is Nolan's best work and it's not even close. Every scene had meaning, no useless scenes or useless dialogue. A lot of people seem to forget it's not just about the Manhattan project, it's about OPPENHEIMER.Most of the bad reviews are from people who think the dark knight trilogy is Nolan's best work.",Oppenheimer

10.0,LEGENDARY,paze-84765,20 July 2023,"Nolan has succeeded to create a different cinematic expirience. An unconventional one.It is the new definition of a SPECTACLE.

6.0,Jumbled storytelling but relevant message,phd_travel,23 July 2023,The screenplay could have been clearer and less confusing. The story should have been told in a linear chronological manner focusing on the creation of the bomb then the communist witch hunt then exoneration. The focus should been less on the interrogation and Robert Downey's character which keeps interrupting the story. Too many characters are introduced and it's hard to keep track of who is who. Should have left out the mistress and the rather gross love scenes. Rather irritating loud strings soundtrack at crucial moments drowns out the dialogue. Typical Nolan. This is unfortunate because the subject matter is fascinating and it does show how scientists helped win WW2.The message in this movie is quite relevant today warning against military build up and confrontation with Russia. Also about how politicians try to discredit those against their policies.,Oppenheimer
10.0,A brilliant masterpiece that cuts to the core of human fear,show24studio,19 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan just stamped his foot print into cinema history as an all time great. It is as if each film he's made has just been a building block leading him to conduct this masterpiece. Oppenheimer is Nolan's finest work. Murphy delivers a sublime performance, reaching a threshold very few actors ever will. Next year's Oscar statue can be put into escrow for Cillian. Nolans three hour plutonium dense genius-of-physics, magnum opus does for the atomic bomb what Spielberg did for sharks at the beach. It seems Christopher Nolan has turned in a tour de force that has vaporized the competition. In fact, Scorsese's 'flowers of the killer moon' may be the only threat of a rival for best picture. However, that may be the toughest act to follow since Einstein's theory of relativity.",Oppenheimer

It's Aldus Huxley's 'Brave New World' and Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis', done with lots of pink and lots of music and dancing, far more than I expected.Margo Robbie pretty much owns this movie, and rightly so. She and Ryan Gosling take over the screen and must of had a load of fun.The set design is very inventive and is very pivotal to the films plot. Never seen so many high heels in a mainstream movie. So many great costumes that help along with the pop background.Really silly and funny look at life, very metaphoric, plenty of fun here, the screening was full, just 6 seats left.",Barbie

This is the kind of movie you live the movie theater why the heck you wasted so much of your time watching this. What kind of audience was this movie made for? Doesn't look like it was made for kids, nor adults. Just a bit more of the work garbage trying to brainwash kids and change the way things are. Who thought this would be a good idea? Same thing happening with big franchises unfortunately. Margo Robbie as Barbie? Some movies like that appeal to our nostalgia, like Mulan, the lion king or scooby doo to name a few.

Its comedy, tragic, musical, hopeful, inspirational and the list goes on just a mess of a rollercoaster. The preaching is just cringe and too much and when you think about it, it gets hypocritical. They wanted to fit so much into this movie but it didnt flow and work together, they didn't finish the ideas they started. No sort of development to be frank. Only good thing about this movie was Ryan gosling in his role of Ken, he carried the movie and did outstanding other than... dont waste money, energy, time like just dont go at all.",Barbie

Both the rhythm of the plot, the tribute to the toy are perfect. Also, from feminism and women's own awakening to the awakening of self is the perfect theme. The plot in the middle of the movie is also very funny and the musical cooperation makes the whole comedy level of the movie to a higher level. By the way, the clothes, buildings, stage properties is a great tribute to toys. In the video, you can see the different Barbies is or was sold in the market, and each Barbie is very distinctive and easy to identify.

7.0,Bloated but full of greatness,guvvernerr,21 July 2023,"My first impression of Oppenheimer was just how loud it all was. Not to criticize the beautiful tones found throughout, but the heaviness and intensity of the music never relented, except for an inevitable central sequence when we finally, mercifully, get a moment of silence. Silence between the pieces of score, and silence between hours of continuous, hyper-paced dialogue and sound design, which all combined sometimes approaches cacophony.The noise of it all sometimes seems an attempt to compensate for a misplaced idea that an audience wouldn't be able to sustain interest in this material without the distraction of a continuous soundtrack. I wish it would have appreciated more moments of quiet. And ironically, in spite of its relentlessness, Oppenheimer ends up the slowest, and most demanding of all Christopher Nolan films.This is not a bad thing. This film is full of smart, engrossing material and succeeds as a rich retelling of Oppenheimer's legacy and the vast network of brains who helped make his Manhattan Project a reality. Multiple viewings are warranted. The cast is spectacular and good use is overall made of them (when we can pin an actor down long enough to even notice their presence), and I can't really blame Nolan anyway, for wanting to spruce up hours of granular physics, debates and testimony into something as awesome as possible.Nolan's movies are gorgeous contraptions, made with exquisite care and a love of an old school sort of practical filmmaking, and they're always ambitious, always outsized. This movie left me with an odd feeling, which is that it was both too long and not long enough. Not long enough to really pierce the enormous scope of what Oppenheimer's life stood for against history, and yet full and stylized almost beyond the brim.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Nolan's surprising movie,therezaimmanuel,21 July 2023,"I'm just gonna pour it here since there's none of my fellow friends who has a same genre and i can discuss with about this amazing movie of NolanI love that this movie is Nolan's longest film. In that way, we can conclude that there's just so much that Nolan would like us to watch and experience. And of course, when it comes to Nolan, there's no doubt it'll be that good and I love how Nolan chose Oppenheimer as his first biopic movie. This explains how Oppenheimer actually had the power to destroy the whole world. I don't think people understand that the atomic bomb, in Oppenheimer's theory and case, could be capable of destroying the entire world. I mean, we're talking about a scientifically proven Marvel Infinity Stones planet destroyer here. But in this case, they made it as a destroyer of a city. As some scenes suggest, there's a minor chance (close to zero) that the chain reaction doesn't stop and burns the whole world.I love Oppenheimer's character too. The way he already knew there would always be people like Lewis Strauss, and even if it's not Lewis, it'll be someone else, and he remains calm about that and continues his work, dedicating it to his beloved country of America (unlike other scientists such as Albert Einstein - who, in this case, had already warned Oppenheimer about the tragedy yet to come). Also, how he manages his household with Kitty that can be so much to take, Tatlock. I mean, people can just be perfect in everything. We are used to the type of person who excels in one area or field, and it's just so satisfying to see how Oppenheimer can handle so many areas in his life successfully. The way he felt guilty and kept being honest about the moment he was about to poison his lecturer shows he really has a good character for us to learn from. Additionally, the way he remains calm and is also a social and charming person on the other side of his intelligence.I love that he never lowers his standards and remains humble about everything. Even after what Strauss did to him and his co-worker testifying against him, he still shook their hands and harbored no hate against each other. He was a very objective and reasonable man. I admire the way he innovated about being effective in working on a remote new city while still finding time for refreshment, a bar, and staying in touch with friends and family, reminding us to have a balance in life. Many scientists use this method nowadays. The responsibility he took for building that city and succeeding in making the atomic bomb faster than Russia is truly commendable.Not to mention, watching the era of big influencer scientists in one movie (Oppenheimer, Einstein, Bohr, and many more) is just so pleasing to watch. And of course i love how Nolan's don't make it just a regular biopic movie, but a little plot twist, puzzle, mind blowing, layered plots like this. There's just a neverending talks about this movie. Great job, NolanAnd this is personal, but I love how he hates math 😂.",Oppenheimer

It's what i saw women doing online and i wanted to be as pretty as they were. Then i grew up and spent so many years being resentful of ""pretty girls"" who i saw daily because they had what i didn't. As a not-conventionally-attractive and disabled woman, i spent days feeling ugly and getting angry at other women and myself because i would never be them or be viewed by other people in the ways that they are. I avoided the mirror for months because i didn't want to see myself. I felt sick looking at my own complexion.It took me years to realise that every girl is a pretty girl. Men will put us down and hate this movie because they don't get it.

8.0,Moral Relativism,alisolimanzaki-25509,23 July 2023,"The movie talks about the moral dilemma of making an atomic bomb, and that helps Oppenheimer, who is obsessed with quantum physics, learn about the atomic field by making an atomic bomb, but what makes him make the bomb is more than his scientific interests; it's about his ideological politics. The movie makes me think more about Oppenheimer as a politician than a scientist at the end of the movie.I think the movie is boring for me because it's longer than I want, but the story of Oppenheimer is not about entertainment; it's about politics and history, and you need to watch this film. I don't believe I will see a nuclear war, and that doesn't make the movie important. As I said, the movie is important for how civilizations think during war or even in peacetime; if you think the movie is about just nuclear war, that's not correct.The cinematography is remarkable; it's very clean. I haven't seen this high quality of cinematography; even Hoyte van Hoytema's previous work didn't look like that.The soundtrack by Ludwig Göransson is very technological, as in his previous works, and classical at the same time, and the theme reminds me of Vangelis's works, especially the soundtrack called ""Destroyer of Worlds."".",Oppenheimer

The casting is really good too, with Gosling excelling in the role of Ken.Regrettably, however, the film completely misses the chance to appeal to people who grew up with Barbie. Instead, we're left with a film that almost divides and pits men against women, in an attempt to make it a feminist and political film.Instead of seeing a light, fun film, I saw a rather heavy-handed movie whose storyline is centered around patriarchy.It's a real shame, because the film's potential is pretty amazing. I came away disappointed, but not totally disgusted either.",Barbie
1.0,Why do people seem to enjoy this?,Leske4,20 July 2023,"The first part of the movie and all the other scenes set in Barbie-land were a huge sensory overload for me. Everything is violently colorful, things happen super fast and everyone is screaming in a strange voice while trying to outscream each other. This Barbie-land is supposed to be a super joyful place but honestly it just made me nauseous. At this point I was praying for it to be over and had a really hard time following what's going on.It gets better when they arrive in the real word, but I seriously don't get why people call it ""deep"" and ""philosophical"" because most of the dialouge is cliché at best and at times it's absolute cringe. It tries real hard to deal with serious topics but keeps explaining things like you're a 5-year-old.Emotions are also portrayed a super weird way in this movie (I guess because we're dealing with dolls, but still, sometimes this level of over-acting just hurts to watch), and a lot of things happen randomly without any explanation. It's also not for (small) kids. There were a lot of really small kids in the cinema when I went and most of them were super confused with some even crying, it was clear they couldn't really follow the plot and didn't get most of the supposed jokes.",Barbie
2.0,Barbie is the worst and most evil,namob-43673,22 July 2023,"Barbie is supposed to be happy, peppy, but here she and her world is the complete opposite. She might smile, and there might be bright colours, but underneath this is dark, very dark. This is also strangely adult with plenty of adult humour. Barbie is usually also about empowerment and be who you are sort of a thing, but that is not what this is about. Not at all. This movie is made out of pure seething hate, hatred of all that is good, proper and real.This might be the darkest, most evil movie I have seen.We watched this just after Oppenheimer, because we wanted to make a full day out of it and watch both movies. And we all know that Oppenheimer is not the happiest movie, with a pretty heavy subject matter, but this Barbie movie is far, far worse. Imagine that? A couple of nuclear bombs killing hundreds of thousands and Barbie is still worse...The positives is that there was a couple of jokes that landed, but only felt weird laughing at anything in this movie. And there were a couple of cute moments, but those only felt forced in there and felt false, like a shadow of what is really going on. The movie is also fairly competently made so I cannot really fault cinematography too much, although there is plenty to complain about there too.I would strongly suggest that you never, ever, take your kids to see this movie. Hide it from them. And to anyone who wants to see this, I suggest you put on a tinfoil hat and drink a lot.2/10 because there are some competence behind making the movie b.",Barbie

A special mention to Michael Cera though for being spot on with his character.It's funny but also unexpectedly touching and really showcases the problems with modern day society in an inventive way.There was also surprises that were good and suited the narrative.Some criticisms are it's drags in certain scenes and it's definitely not for everyone but I guess that's cinema for you.Barbie is worth the watch!Edit: actually watched it for a second time and it's just a fun movie with really detailed set designs and cleverly thought out mannerisms.",Barbie

10.0,Awesome,MFC9,23 July 2023,"So Oppenheimer didn't disappoint. Prepare for a relentlessly tense three hour investment with ample exposition and borderline horror tropes. Also prepare for a Titanic-style treasure trove of Oscars come award season. Cillian already has one hand on his statue, while Nolan will surely take home Best Film and Director. Downey might also sneak a Best Supporting. But the true master here is Ludwig Goransson, whose score ensures the exposition is never boring, amping up the tension to unbearable levels of dread. Couldn't believe it wasn't Hans Zimmer when I looked it up. Add the unbelievable sound mix and Oppenheimer is terrifyingly unsettling. It has all the hallmarks of classic docudramas like JFK and 13 Days, with MTV editing and time jumps, but is a superior film that must be seen on a big screen, preferably IMAX. Awesome 10/10.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Christopher Nolan never disappoints.,vrpqqzxp,22 July 2023,"First of all, English is not my first language, So sorry if I'm not clear. Anyways,the movie is such a masterpiece though he is 3h. With those 3h I think Nolan could cut a few seconds or two minutes. But the movie is so good. The cast, the effects the sound, I specifically watched the movie in Imax, which made the experience a lot more better with the sound and the big screen, Cillian Murphy's performance in the movie was insane. It just felt so real. I think. Cillian and Christopher definitely deserves a oscar for this movie. When I watched the movie it didn't felt at all like a 3h one minute I got into the cinema and one minute the movie has ended. Actually I didn't accept for the movie to be so good. Before the movie I thought it would suck like a movie I've watched a few months ago, I just left this movie before a half hour of it, but in Oppenheimer it was different, the act of all the cast was insane. The effects were so good and realistic. And the sound literally blow my mind. As soon as the movie has come out I told my friend ""we are going to this movie, whether you want to or not."" He also thought the movie was great, I think it is definitely deserve a watch. But I gave it 9/10 because Nolan could make it shorter in my opinion, but without the 3h the movie is definitely a 10/10 even with the fact the movie is 3 hours, it is definitely deserves a watch!. As I said in the title, Christopher Nolan never disappoints.",Oppenheimer
10.0,God film,dimitarialmishev,26 July 2023,"Watched Oppenheimer in imax, packed cinema. Let me tell you something: when a movie makes you feel certain emotions and forget that you're in a movie then you know that the director did his best. Nolan said: If you don't understand my movie try to feel it, oh boy have I felt it the whole 3hours and 9 seconds of it, and it went so quick I was ready for more. I was worried, scared, laughed, felt anxious and angry. Went through a lot in those 3 hours. Now that was quite the experience. And that's the point of it I guess, that's exactly what I wanted. My opinion is that this film is a masterpiece..",Oppenheimer
7.0,Meh,jackcummings-35759,21 July 2023,"Visuals, fantastic. Acting, great. Plot, lacklustre. Was a long watch being 3+ hours, could definitely have been portrayed closer to 2 hours instead. There's a lot of talking and for me, not enough concentrating on the physical creation of the bomb (which would break up all the talking scenes). I also didn't really notice a massive difference in IMAX to that of a standard showing, bar the 'bomb' scene. It's a worth a watch once but won't go back for a second viewing. Definitely my least favourite film from Nolan unfortunately.Also a little worrying seeing these 'best film ever watched' reviews! I know the 2023 standard of films has been poor but still!",Oppenheimer
9.0,"It isn't for everyone, but it is for me.",alexandragarnham,22 July 2023,"It definitely lived up to my expectations. Walking into the theater I was scared. Considering all the amazing marketing and promotion for this movie, it could've been easily disappointing, but it wasn't for me. The acting was amazing, the jokes and dialogue were funny, but most importantly, it had a message and they stick to it throughout the movie. I don't think the world is ready for a film centered around women, maybe it's too soon. I think some men will wrongly assume that it is an ""anti-men"" movie and they will hate it for it. It's far from that. My hope is that, with time, people will understand its message and realize that we're all Kenough.",Barbie
10.0,"A Masterful Journey Through History: Strong Message, Cinematic Triumph",karakhetik,23 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer delivers an immersive blend of sadness and fear, unfolding the nonlinear narrative of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life. The portrayal of human folly and pursuit of power is chilling. Pacing, sound, and editing create an unparalleled cinematic experience.

9.0,Fast paced editing tightly written screenplay. Exciting & Brilliant,arshbhinder-92939,23 July 2023,"The feel the look of the movie takes you to that time that era of history, the fast paced editing of dialogue scenes makes the movie exciting,even though the movie is very much based upon dialogues , conversations but short lenghth of scenes and fast paced editing takes down all the boredom & movie feels very fast. 3 hours long but time flies. Not 10 because of no action but that is understandable as the movie is a biopic. For the biopic genre also the movie feels very intelligent & brilliant, the screenplay is tightly written & the the non linear timeline makes you to give more attention to the screen as you don't want to loose & left behind. Christopher nolan never disappoints.",Oppenheimer
10.0,ANOTHER NOLAN MASTERPIECE,hkruvyx,28 July 2023,"It was the way that Nolan presented the story of a historic man was mind blowing. Nothing short of brilliance and the practical effects. Must watch for every one.Cillian Murphy was at his best. And my my Robert Downey Jr, a class act. Nolan always uses most of his cast members from his previous films. It's like he adores them.In short acting was top notch.Direction was top notch.Writing was top notch.It was a 3 hour masterpiece and not once did I feel that the movie has lost its pace or I want the movie to end. Nolan is definitely one of the greatest filmmakers of our time. WB you just lost a gem!",Oppenheimer

All the characters were just spot on.The film thoroughly captivated, enchanted, and spellbound me.The film rated a perfect 10 out of 10 rating! It had scope to be corny or a rght duff, but it completely surpassed my expectations.I totally plan to download this film when it comes out. One for all the girls out there.",Barbie
7.0,A Stellar First Two Acts Followed by a Relatively Disappointing Third,nysmbs,26 July 2023,"Barbie is agonizingly close to being a masterpiece. Imagine your run of the mill 2020s high budget film. Now let's go through it with a fine comb and add a bunch of brilliant tiny details to the first two acts, but then let's have a third act that fits the modern trend of overstaying its welcome and failing to provide satisfactory answers to its own questions and lacks all those fun little bits that made you love the first two thirds of the movie.Without spoiling plot, Barbie much like Game of Thrones and Hunger Games hints at complex understanding of social and political issues but ultimately settles on the safest most vanilla possible answers to those problems. It also, in modern fashion, wastes time going off on tangents.I feel, much like Margot Robbie, pulled in two directions. A part of me wants to praise the film for shedding on light on feminist issues while another wishes to tear it to shreds for copping out in the end.The further one gets into Barbie, the less its complexities feel like they are there to make a point, and the more it feels they are there to fill time.If you're like me you'll leave in a disappointed but forgiving mood. Even if the ending fumbles what was set up, I can't forget my enjoyment of the setting up itself.",Barbie
10.0,An absolute must see,kevin_robbins,23 July 2023,"Oppenheimer (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters tonight. The storyline follows a Princeton professor who is teaching a theory on a radical new science during World War II. The Germans and Japan are winning the war, and the arms race to build the next great bomb could tip the outcome. The scientist is asked to help the United States military create a bomb that could end the war. He will need to deal with the ethical aspects before, during and after the creation of the ask, as well as manage his personal life and political pressures.This movie is directed by Christopher Nolan (Tenet) and stars Cillian Murphy (28 Days Later), Emily Blunt (The Devil Wears Prada), Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting), Robert Downey Jr. (Iron Man), Florence Pugh (Midsommar), Casey Affleck (Gone Baby Gone), Rami Malek (Bohemian Rhapsody) and Gary Oldman (True Romance).This period piece is masterfully put together in every way. The storyline has depth, worthwhile subplots and dynamic characters. The cast is brilliantly selected and deliver tremendous performances - Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr are amazing. The cinematography was top notch and the lone action sequence was well executed, though some scenes of the bombings in Japan would have kicked it up a notch. I adored the depiction of all the scientists from this era. The ending twists and turns I never saw coming. This is worth every minute.Overall, this will be the best film of 2023 and is an absolute must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Probably the most subversive movie I've seen,ziyutalkology,20 July 2023,"Well, English is not my first language so I'll try my best here.With the complete deconstruction of the concept of ""Barbie"", Gerwig subverted every stereotype you've associated with this ""not-so-feminist"" toy. She took an innovative approach to story-telling, struck a balance between flamboyant shots and down-to-earth narrative. Behind every joke there is a harsh reality. It's light-hearted yet solemn, comprehensible yet arduous, optimistic yet depressing. For I know this world is not gonna be as acceptable as the movie wants it to be. Just look at these 1/10 reviews here. I hope Gerwig will make more movies like Barbie because I need it, we need it.",Barbie
9.0,The most intense biopic I've seen,deliriutopiasq,22 July 2023,"This movie is 3 hours long, and in this time it tries not to be boring for the viewer. The intense shifts of flashbacks and flashforwards are keeping the movie fascinationg to watch. The scenes from Oppenheimer's life and other people related to him is like a puzzle, that is interesting to collide into the whole chronological picture.The visuals are stunning, montage is fast-pased and never getting boring, and dialogues with music can definitely tell you that this is Christopher Nolan's movie.I eould re-watch it at the future, because I would like to understand story more. It already is turning to the cult classic. This movie exists to become one.One of the concerns I have-the moment of atomic explosion. The buildup was massive, but compared to it, the explosion felt flat and not-impactful.",Oppenheimer
8.0,A great film filled with complexity and history,cinemalad,22 July 2023,"A very fast paced film that jumped forwards and backwards a lot. Additionally, it had some weird decisions regarding music and camera movement that (I'm not an expert on the art of film making but I enjoy it and study it). Can be hard to follow if you don't have enough knowledge regarding American and War history. A small amount of scenes could've in my opinion, done without the loud music as it made it difficult to understand dialogue and feel connected in the story. However, the film had amazing performances by the cast, brilliant use of sound and lighting to influence the audience's emotions as well as incredible visuals that invite you into the story. Creating a historical film can be challenging as the actions of characters and events are extremely limited to what is and was accurate, but Christopher Nolan delivers a powerful film that covers a significant event in history, which needs to be acknowledged more as it has impacted society a lot more than people think.",Oppenheimer
7.0,A Good Movie That Should Have Been A Great Movie,jgeorge4,22 July 2023,"This was a very fun, very engaging premise. I don't know if I'd call it groundbreaking, since it's a little derivative of Toy Story and Extra Guy, but this definitely works. The scenery and cast are great, and the movie bristles with energy.I just wish they kept this a little more light-hearted and a little less preachy. There are countless movies that lament victimhood and discrimination, and countless movies that showcase estranged parents and children magically reuniting through remarkable events. But how many great comedies are there these days? How about, for once, just keeping things light and entertaining? (The patriarchy? Seriously?)Regardless, I think most of the audience loved it, and I think most of the women wanted to stand up and cheer during the Mom's big speech. It's a visual feast with just enough laughs and a lot of star power, and you will probably be glad you went.",Barbie
9.0,Did we watch the same movie?,dnkqbzw,22 July 2023,"I found Barbie to be funny, self-deprecating, intelligent and masterfully pretty. The choice of making Barbieworld feel plastic adds an incredible layer of humor to it all.Gosling, Margot Robbie and cast are a charming ensemble of top tier performers giving their all and it shows. Robbie's self-serious approach to Barbie makes Gosling's self-seriousness as Ken even funnier.When I left Barbie, all I could think is ""This movie is SO PG-13"" in the best way possible. It's sexless, while also acknowledging sex and physical attraction. It's crude without raunchy language. It's self-deprecating humor is second to none. It's absurdist humor is uniquely millennial/Gen Z. I found this film hilarious and fun.I recommend everyone watches this and also doesn't take it too seriously.",Barbie
9.0,"A fun, comedically-awesome time!",nicholasrhettlever,23 July 2023,"Storyline: 8.5- Great story, could've been fleshed out more in some areas to have an even better overall connection; nonetheless, it still has a great plot, conflict, climax, etc. A little silly at times; but, it is a movie about Barbie. Pacing was good and easy to follow. It is, in my opinion, just about the perfect movie length at an hour and 54 minutes.Cinematography: 8.75- There are some really great cinematic shots throughout the film. Clear distinction between ""Barbie Land"" and ""The Real World"". Good angling on all characters.Acting & Costumes/Makeup- 9.75- The acting was wonderful. Every actor pulled their weight and shined. Many comedic moments that will have you laughing nearly to tears. Also, very serious moments that are executed well in such a way that may bring you to tears. The costumes & makeup were beautiful.Music Soundtrack: 9.5- Overall, extremely strong movie soundtrack. All of the songs align with the theme of what is happening during the current scenes & the storyline. The weakest song (and I mean from a vocal standpoint) is the one sung by Ryan Gosling.Choreography- 9- There is a fair amount of choreography in the film, and there is an all-ken dancing scene that is phenomenal.Overall: 9.1/10. This movie is PG-13 for a reason. There are lots of mature references. It is a movie made for adults, not kids. Definitely worth a watch, though, so go see it!",Barbie
6.0,"A Gary Oldman Truman Biopic, Please",dway-68382,24 July 2023,"A Truman biopic with Gary Oldman playing the lead is what this film really left me wanting to see. Sadly, the Truman scene was maybe 5 minutes long but it was clearly the most honest dialogue in the movie.This movie is not about the Manhattan project. This movie is liberal hand-wringing over two things: (1) having used the bomb and (2) the hunt to get communists out of sensitive government positions. I get that immediately following the use of the bomb people thought we had opened Pandora's box. But here we are 78 years later and neither we nor anyone else has used one again. And we now know communists were in sensitive positions. Yet the tears continue to flow.Beautifully shot, well acted, but boring. I guarantee you will google ""How long is Oppenheimer"" during the movie. You will also say, ""Hey, why is the music so loud all of the sudden? They are just walking down the street.""This was a bail and switch.PS ... whatever reviewer says this is the greatest war movie ever is high on crack.",Oppenheimer
10.0,This film will inspire generations film makers.,nwnzqcgr,21 July 2023,"I'm over the moon with this film. From the visuals to the dialogue and the score. It is simply a masterpiece. Robert Downey, Jr. And Cillian Murphy both Deserves an Academy award. Cillian holds this film on his shoulders in a way I have never seen before. For 3 hours I was transported back to WW2 and the beginning of the military industrial complex.If you are going to this movie for action or to see the bombing of Hiroshima, you will be disappointed. This movie is a think piece. The challenge is the audience to think on moral levels challenging each of us just because we can should we.I plan on seeing this tomorrow and the day after. I'm sure there were things I missed and can't wait to discover by watching again.Christopher Nolan has definitely outdone himself. If I were him I would be honestly scared of my next project because how can you top this masterpiece. If anyone can I believe he can I just can't wait for his next release.",Oppenheimer
1.0,Worse Barbie Movie EVER!!!,sunbeach_rocks,24 July 2023,"I grew up watching Barbie, my kids watched every Barbie movie. This was AWFUL! Extremely dumb, language was uncalled for (mother Bleep, vagina, penis, I'd like to see the blob in his jeans), on top of Mattel being made something it isn't. Where are all the other Barbie characters? Ryan, Raquelle, Summer, or her little sisters? At many points I was either yawning or asking myself why am I continuing to sit through this? I took up for the movie and told people it couldn't be that bad they were just being too judge-mental. Na I was wrong! It's terrible and I can't say that enough. You failed us!!",Barbie
10.0,Better than The Dark Knight,ejmazur,22 July 2023,"This was one of the most transcendent, intellectually harrowing and emotionally horrifying experiences I've ever had. Not at the movies, EVER. I believe this is by far Nolan's most emotional piece (yes, I'd put this above interstellar) and as someone who needs no introduction in terms of cerebral movies, it was absolutely incredible for that to be paired with a sense of visceral character explorations. And make no mistake, this movie will haunt you. And terrify you. I'm the biggest horror nut around, having seen Jaws before I turned 8, and from then, the shining, Blair witch, Halloween, terrifier, NONE of them scared me like this. This movie scared me so much I started crying and shaking in my seat.",Oppenheimer
10.0,The best film of 2023!,djrmc24,22 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan has done it again with his latest release of Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer is a mind bending epic biopic of the father of the Atom bomb. Now please note this movie might not be for everyone because it is extremely dense with heavy dialogue and stays true to the real life story in life of Oppenheimer. Those who are expecting an action extravagansa will be sadly disappointed. I really enjoyed the visual journey that this film takes you on and it is amazing to me that Nolan used zero CGI shots in this film. This star studded movie showcases some amazing Oscar worthy performances from all of it's Leads with Cillian Murphy, Roberty Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt. Even the smaller roles bring all of their A games. I got the opportunity to watch this in 70mm Imax and when I say this is truly how Nolan wanted you to see it as intended, I mean it. The movie was breathtaking and such an important film to see in this day in age. Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer gets a perfect 10 out of 10 for me.

Some people are seriously going to this movie expecting to have a "" fun"" time. Tho movie speaks about ""probably"" the world's biggest catastrophe EVER.

8.0,"Another Christopher Nolan gem, but something feels a bit off with the pacing & portrayal",cristanrafael,19 July 2023,"Some of the things I think are good about this movie:Nolan's approach of CGI minimalism.The awesome acting by its cast members, I especially think Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Jason Clarke as the highlights of the actingFantastic choice of B&W/color scenesHaunting and awesome score by Ludwig GöranssonThe dialogues that represent the politics, dilemmas, dissent, and scientific discussions that go behind the Trinity testBut I can't help but to feel that something feels incomplete/off about the pacing and portrayal in the movie, it feels like some scenes are too lengthy and sort of dominate other aspects of the story that should have gotten more screen time instead. I mean, don't get me wrong, this movie is awesome and it definitely immerses people into Oppenheimer's great and tragic life story and shows how important of a person he was, but it feels like there is an imbalance in the storytelling and how long things are told. It feels like considering the significance of the story of Oppenheimer, there is something that feels imbalanced in the film.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Gorgeous,josephirose,26 July 2023,"This movie was incredible, it so perfectly portrays the patriarchy and feministic ideas. It really stood out to me how the worst the Kens had to go through in Barbieland was being ignored and being not very important, while the second Barbie went to the real world she was harassed and objectified. It ended up STILL being up to Barbie to ""apologize"" to Ken at the end of the movie though she did nothing wrong! This movie was hilarious and saddening and perfect, and it did a fantastic job of showing patriarchal things and balancing the serious and sad, with the funny and tender moments. I love Great Gerwig and would for sure see this again.",Barbie
7.0,Felt like I watched 3 hours of C-SPAN!,saumya-nanduru,21 July 2023,"I found the movie so boring, with a ton of exposition, unending dialog and undue screen time dedicated to the most boring issue which is his security clearance. How could a genius like Nolan not find a more cinematic way to reveal the the characters or consequences of strong opinions by scientific community, than a hearing, not just 1 but 2. . Also how can a movie about a scientist not have any meaningful or educative explanation of nuclear physics or anatomy of the bomb? Even the fictional setup in Inception was explained in a more detailed fashion.Some highlights that I wish they spent more time on: 1) Silence during explosion. Loved that it was an Easter egg for people who love science. It was a choice made not necessarily for an artistic reason but a scientific one, as light travels faster than sound. Wish there were more such.2) When one character tells Strauss that Einstein and Oppen were probably not talking about him, but something important instead. I wish Nolan applied that to his film and realized that spending majority of the movie on Strauss' trial is not as important when the world the movie is set in involves Oppenheimer, Einstein, Atom bomb, WW2, a world after the first nuclear attack, nuclear arms race, the dynamic of great scientific minds from the world coming together to build the bomb/advance science.3) Psychological complexity and catharsis: there were hints at what caused the eventual change of mind within Oppen towards the bomb, but it didn't seem organic to me. Was it triggered by Matt Damon's character ending communication with Oppen, or because of the way the test bombing looked, or hearing Truman announce the attack on Hiroshima on radio? Or meeting Truman?4) Terrific acting all the way.I am huge Nolan fan and my favs are Prestige, Interstellar, Dark Knight Rises.",Oppenheimer
1.0,I'm a shallow writer in a preaching world,aussiefilmguy556,23 July 2023,"The film started off in the Barbie world with beautiful cinematography and characters which came off as conveying childlike innocence and bombastic ideals. This innocence almost gave the sense of nostalgia for both men and women alike to a time and place that life was more simpler and about fun as a child.As the film progresses, a not so subtle and preachy message of the patriarch is constantly shoved down your throat in ways you cannot ignore it and continue on watching the film.The film attempts to deliver humor in a way that mocks gender and patriarchy norms but severely misses the mark and instead comes off as lacking intellect in its construction and concepts and at times weird attempts at humor such as Barbie telling the construction workers "" I don't have a Vagina and he doesn't have a penis"".The entirety of the film seems to be made in an attempt for teens and young children to be able to come and watch a deeply political and often sexualized film in a dumbed down mannerism for them to absorb its simplicity, but has backfired into a protest like rant down your throat and no room for enjoyment unless you hold similar views to the director.There was great potential for this film if it focused on great storytelling and character development as opposed to pushing the issues and political viewpoints of the director.Overall, a lost opportunity for something great.",Barbie
10.0,"Funny, Visually Stunning, Emotional, & Engaging!",baybaysulzy,27 July 2023,"This movie made me so proud to be a woman and really appreciate the human experience! It's amazing that a film centered around a toy managed to shed light on the genuine highs and lows of being human, making it a refreshing watch! It was funny, visually stunning, emotionally resonant and engaging. I'm not sure why some have labeled it as ""preachy"" or ""agenda-driven,"" because it merely highlighted the realities faced by women today. If these aspects were challenging to watch, that might have been the film's intent - to resonate with its target audience. I appreciate that the movie reminds us what Barbie's original purpose was, to empower girls around the world! So to everyone who feels that this movie was a personal attack, it might be best for you to stop over analyzing every little thing because you weren't the target audience anyway. Highly recommend!!",Barbie
3.0,Warning- this is not a family film,daniju,23 July 2023,"I had my reservations going in due to the fact that this was directed by ""mumblecore"" maestro Gerwig, who was last seen modernising little women to ensure a more feminist ending, but the trailers gave the impression of a fun dish out of water, Elf Meeta enchanted vibe.Instead we got an extended diatribe against men for two hours, albeit amidst some funny scenes and lovely set design. Watching empowered, millionaire actors, writers and directors scream about their oppression by all men is not entertaining, and I found it sad later to see all the excited little.girls waiting to see the next show, to know that they are going to spend the afternoon essentially being told of the evils of their Dads, sitting next to them in the screen!",Barbie
10.0,Go watch this now!!!,yhulstaert,19 July 2023,"This is the first ever IMDB review that I write because I need to give this movie my stars. The camera work is amazing. The cast is amazing and the story is even better. The only downside was the fast pacing wich you may see as a positive thing and the use op a lot of different names for characters. The use of those names was somethimes a little confusing but it does not really affect the story as it is always clear after some thime who they are referring to. Me and my friend just sat there in the cinema after the movie was done. Both baffeled by what happend and the ending. I got goosebumps 3 times from some moments in the movie, never had that before in my life. I have read some negative reviews wich say it was boring.... The only thing they think is not boring is dangeling from a thin wire above a 30meter drop or something but this movie was not even close to boring.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Christopher Nolan is the master!,srjbrett,22 July 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" is a magnum opus that showcases Christopher Nolan's brilliance as a filmmaker. Spanning four decades of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life, the film masterfully weaves a scrambled chronology, captivating audiences with its absorbing narrative. Cillian Murphy delivers a mesmerizing performance, embodying Oppenheimer's complex and enigmatic persona. Nolan's monumentalist approach immerses us in the grandeur of the story, exploring the moral implications of Oppenheimer's work and the era's social complexities. The movie's visuals are a symphony of artistry, magnificently capturing the essence of the Los Alamos years and Strauss' sequences. With a stellar supporting cast, ""Oppenheimer"" ignites essential discussions that remain relevant today. Nolan's cinematic brilliance elevates ""Oppenheimer"" to a profound and timeless work of art, leaving a lasting impact on its audiences.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Entertaining if a Bit Feministic,breathinglifehouse,23 July 2023,"Went into this movie knowing it'd be hilariously awkward. Robbie as Barbie and Gosling as Ken. Also a great supporting cast including Ferrell, Cena, Cera, Ferrera, Liu, McKinnon, just to name a few. It was thoroughly entertaining but a few segments were a bit too preachy on feminism, but that's to be expected when it's a Barbie movie. This film had great costume and set designs and will win Oscars for those two categories for sure. It will most likely be nominated in all the major categories. My only hope is that this destroys Mission Impossible at the box office so we can witness Barbie defeating Tom Cruise.

It's full of irony and sarcasm, visually amazing. The level of detail on the toys, clothes, etc!!If you think it's just a feminist movie, give it a chance, if your smart enough to understand and read into the details, it will make you se a different perspective on what's feminism actually mean.I don't think it's inappropriate for kids however, they have to be certain age to understand the movie!This is already pop culture icon, hopefully opening minds in every generation!",Barbie
3.0,Good acting but poor storyline,ksl93090,23 July 2023,"If it matters for an age perspective, I'm 32. I really wanted to like this movie, but it was disappointing. The actors did a good job with what they were given, and the Barbieland costumes and set design were great. But it was a poor storyline. Being a comedy, there were only about 3 moments that I found funny. I noticed the audience in the theater didn't laugh much either. I think the advertising for this was better than the actual film. The media really hyped this movie up and of course currently all the major headlines are rave reviews. But it's definitely not worth the hype. I know I won't ever watch this movie again.",Barbie
10.0,Better than expected,dhanushsirohi,22 July 2023,Being a huge barbie fan I had to go watch this movie and let me tell you it did not disappoint. Started as a fun kids movie but took a. Wry interesting turn with its story line.The display of patriarchy in real world using barbie land was so smartly done.A great direction with attention to details that makes this so much fun to watch.Some of the moments will make you burst out laughing and some will make you really emotional.It's a movie for every age group but absolutely a must watch for teenagers.My fiancé watched it with me who doesn't know anything about barbies but has a wonderful time. He rated it 8/10 so that's quite a lot.Enjoy.,Barbie
9.0,A Magnificent Piece of Cinema,Dan_W_Reviews,21 July 2023,"Oppenheimer has left a profound impact on me. The film's storytelling and character study were brilliantly executed, drawing me into the life and mind of J Robert Oppenheimer. Cillian Murphy's performance was nothing short of exceptional, bringing depth and authenticity to the character.Visually, the film was a treat to behold. The cinematography, especially if you see it in IMAX, it adds that immersive quality that really enhanced the overall experience. The attention to detail in recreating historical settings was also commendable, making the film feel remarkably authentic.Oppenheimer managed to strike a balance between explosive action and cerebral depth, showcasing Christopher Nolan's prowess as a filmmaker. It's a captivating blend of thought-provoking themes and enthralling storytelling, which left me contemplating the implications long after the credits rolled.While the film had many strengths, I think that it could have been even more impactful if some of the female characters like Jean Tatlock had a bit more character development. This aspect felt somewhat lacking and deserved more attention in my opinion.Overall though, Oppenheimer is a magnificent piece of cinema that stands out as one of Christopher Nolan's best works. It's a film that engages the mind and emotions, and which will leave a lasting impression.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Masterpiece,yigityildiz-53445,24 July 2023,"The movie is a masterpiece. You can feel the character's difficulties and the storms blowing inside him deeply and sincerely. I saw the movie in IMAX and if you had told me it was a horror movie I wouldn't have objected. Albert Einstein was handled very well and the connection between what Openheimer said to him in the last scene and the first scene was perfect and fascinating. Personally, I felt Openheimer's regret even in myself. Chillian Murphy did a great job and even the supporting actors in the movie were Oscar-worthy. After leaving the movie, I questioned life for about 15 minutes in the corridor of the cinema and I felt the same feeling even at home. A movie that will stay with you for a long time after watching it. Classic Christopher Nolan Thank you.",Oppenheimer
7.0,The good for the greater bad,web-534-393830,27 July 2023,"I took a couple of days to digest three hours of slow burn drama so here we are, ready to blast an impossibly objective review. Let's begin with the obvious: this is 100% Nolaned; the script is clean and meticulous; Robert Downey Jr stands out for best acting followed by Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt; Matt Demon isn't credible; the music is too insidious; the visuals and the story itself aren't worthy of a big screen. Now that the most evident is dissected, here is the trick. The movie portraits an American patriot that oscillates between pride and guilt with enough elements to pull in both directions simultaneously. And when you think the script was a straight line without twists (and you would be right), subplots emerge to at least complete three hours of dialogues with emoted tension and resolution in the life of a scientist, the father of the atomic bomb, turned both monster and hero. My biggest turn off is that he story and the film deserve two hours - not three.",Oppenheimer
10.0,One of the most real and complex movies I've seen.,ysszhb,22 July 2023,"Every one - man and woman, should watch this movie with an open-mind and introspection about current society. Barbie was one of the most real, complex, insightful, trippiest, thoughtful, and educational videos I've watched in a long time. This movie is not for everyone and is definitely not designed for kids due to the much deeper meaning. To get the full experience of the art of the movie, you have to ready to focus and peel all the symbolic layers.I came in expecting a lighthearted, fun, and silly movie like how you expect the stereotypical Barbie brand. But the movie brought so much more depth and substance. Be ready for a rollercoaster of emotions!",Barbie
1.0,Deadly dull,rogerwapiti,24 July 2023,"This is one of the most tedious boring fims I have seen in a long time. 3 hours was about 21/2 hours too long. Unless you actually knew the history you would not be much wiser. How many people know how thermonuclear fission and fusion work and why it was so important. Odd bits were good but the constant jumping about was annoying. The casting was stereotyped although the actors did the best they could in the circumstances. And why did the sound have to be so deafening? The visual effects were cliched. Real pictures of an atomic bomb going off are dramatic enough without the swirling clouds. PS I hated Dunkirk too so I guess I am in the minority. I yearn for the days of cinema when there was a good story, well told and well acted. David Lean where are you? (I gues that gives my age away!)",Oppenheimer
8.0,Great work. Amazing movie. But I found something which should not be in the movie,omrohit,24 July 2023,I feel now Openheimer is more popular than Albert Einstein after this movie and everyone knows. Great movie best screenplay another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan. Apparently scientific part in the movie was very small. They could have added more how they built the bomb. What is heavy waters. I found that in the scene where Openheimer sitting in his house with his wife on a dining table there is an Ethernet port or analog telephone port in the back wall. I observed this 2 times in the movie. I am sure that there was no ethernet and phone ports. I am writing it here because I could not find anywhere to report. Let me know if you feel the same.,Oppenheimer

10.0,You are the man who gave them the power to destroy themselves,srikanthjonnalagadda,22 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan knocks it out of the park with Oppenheimer. The film is a delight, and is truly meant for the big screen. The ensemble cast assembled for the project deliver the goods.Glad to see Cillian Murphy's loyalty to Nolan, get rewarded with a leading and an impactful role. The cinematography, music were just flawless.While some might feel the film was a tad too long, I disagree with them. 3 hours was totally justifiable for the way the story was paced, and kept me gripped the whole time.The film is the perfect representation of what humans are capable of in our darkest moments.",Oppenheimer
9.0,A Dark Merlin,Pairic,24 July 2023,"Oppenheimer: The Manhattan Project is central to this film but it is also about how Oppenheimer's intellectual development, his life and loves. Cillian Murphy is devastating in his portrayal of the great scientist whose mind was wracked with strange thoughts of the stars and of the Quantum World, a womaniser, drinker, chain smoker. Great luminaries like Heisenberg (Matthias Schweighöfer), Nils Bohr (Kenneth Branagh) and Einstein (Tom Conti) have walk on parts or cameos. The Einstein cameo proves to be central to the films narrative though. The film unfolds through two hearing and Oppenheimer's career progression on to being Director of the Manhattan Project. The hearing on Oppenheimer's security clearance in 1954 shows how he was deserted by many friends and colleagues but also uncovers the Iago behind this assault on his integrity. In ways Oppenheimer was his own worst enemy, careless in his choice of friends and too quick to make enemies. There are too many characters to cover in any one review but Emily Blunt puts in a creditable performance as Kitty Oppenheimer, having to hold things together, putting her life as a botanist on hold. General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon) stood by Oppenheimer in 1954 but their relationship is portrayed as being stormy during the Los Alamos years, fights over security clearances for other scientists and even Oppenheimer himself due to past political associations. We even get to see Oppenheimer's involvement in unionising scientists. Even though we know the outcome the tension builds as the Trinity Test approaches. Fermi (Danny Deferrari) makes book on how may kilotonnes the explosion will be with a side bet on the atmosphere igniting. A tale of victory, betrayal but also of how scientists had differing opinions on the use of atomic weapons and the post war use of atomic energy. The two hearings head towards a conclusion just as the Manhattan Project does, all three resulting in different levels of destruction. Written and Directed by Christopher Nolan. 9/10.",Oppenheimer

7.0,The wait was worth it.,gianmarcocibella,21 July 2023,"It's hard to say this movie isn't great even if you don't agree with the third act feminism part. I mean, Margot Robbie nailed it!

The set production and Costume design are, of course, oscar nominees already.Overall i liked the message, the social critic, the perfomances, the production, the jokes were very funny, the references... what's there not to like? Such an enjoyable movie. Perhaps the part played by America Ferrera required a most skilled actress to carry the emotive part of the movie and the monologue in a more convincing way, but that doesn't ruin the movie at all.

6.0,"Breaks all filmmaklng rules, but not in a good way",timmyhollywood,23 July 2023,"Okay, Nolan fans, get your fingers poised to downvote what I'm about to say. That's the only way I can understand the high rating for this film - thousands of devoted Nolan fans inflating the score. Because if you're honest, there's no way this mottled mess of a movie is an 8.9. Not in any sane universe.I've seen all of Nolan's films. Memento was a brilliant calling card for a young director and The Dark Knight elevated superhero movies to something amazing, gritty and crackling with verisimilitude. But Inception was a long slog of exposition, and Interstellar, while offering some good moments, also imploded under the weight of the writer-director's ego.Nolan likes to tackle big ideas. Dreams and outer space. Here, he delves into quantum physics, but it's relegated to a line, really, that Oppenheimer offers Kitty before marrying her. He explains quantum physics as mostly space in which particles have an ""attraction"" to one another... and then they hold hands.For the first two hours of Oppenheimer, I was lost in a blizzard of short, disparate scenes, constant musical score, actors chewing through endless dialog. You are never allowed to rest, never really sure where or when you are. Nolan offers only two cryptic title cards at the very beginning: 1. Fission and 2. Fusion. (Or maybe it was the other way around.) He separates the time period of public hearing, with Robert Downey Jr. As the main character, by desaturating to black and white. But other than the make-up used to age or de-age Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer, you never really know quite where you are, or where it fits in sequentially or contextually into the story.There is the public hearing, and there is a closed hearing with a wolf pack of hungry prosecutors, and then there is some semblance of Oppenheimer's backstory - his love life, his gradual involvement in government, leading to a general (Matt Damon) for some reason hiring him to be the head of Los Alamos. All of this is mashed together, scenes never really more than a few seconds long before cutting to somewhere else, something else, often interpolated with macro shots of things fizzing and roiling and exploding. I assume that's supposed to be some sort of visual metaphor for the work Oppenheimer is doing, his theorizing and contemplating, but that's it, for any demonstration of the actually ""work"" Oppenheimer does, save one scene near the beginning where he inadvertently shatters a beaker in class and we hear he's terrible in a lab.Yet, without exaggeration, by an hour into the movie, we've been told at least ten times that Oppenheimer is brilliant, or a ""genius."" We're just never shown why. And this is Nolan's chief sin - he is a teller, not a shower. A writer, not really a director.Take ""A Beautiful Mind"" for comparison. In that movie, director Ron Howard regularly visualizes the work of John Nash. He shows him, for instance, watching pigeons gather crumbs, and in his mind's eye he maps their pattern. Or on a window overlaying the view outside of some young men playing sports, he uses a piece of white pastel to draw a diagram of them. Film is a visual medium.Consider ""Schindler's List"" (or any Spielberg movie, really), and observe the blocking of the actors, the placement of the camera, all in service of telling the story visually. An actor may dominate the frame, or maybe have his back turned. Characters may move and create an entirely new frame (blocking). Their relationship to each other and to the camera help tell the story.In Nolan's filmmaking, where the camera goes is really arbitrary. And where he cuts the shot has to do with his writing, not the actors reaction or the blocking of the scene, so that the editing feels off, clunky, the shot moving off of an actor at the start of a reaction, or coming back with an actor already in motion. This is because Nolan is cutting for the script, relying on dialog to tell the entire story. Even plays have blocking.True, he decides to tell the story of the ""Father of the A-Bomb"" chiefly through these two hearings, the public one and the closed one, so there's going to be lots of talking. But then he doubles down on the talking - on the telling - even further. In one scene, Casey Affleck sits beside Oppenheimer in some room somewhere (I don't even know who Affleck was playing, really, it was very short) and while he's talking to Oppenheimer, Nolan cuts back and forth to another scene with Matt Damon on a train with Oppenheimer, and Damon is telling us about Affleck and who he is and what he wants.Character should be revealed through action. Not some other character explaining everything off to the side.There are a great many cameos in Nolan's film - it is ""star studded."" But rather than the appearance of a name actor helping to clarify the character portrayed, they distract. At one point, a woman near me in the theater said ""Oh, look who that is,"" when Remi Malek appeared. We're focused on the actor and their previous roles, not the character.Everything in this movie, especially the first ninety minutes, bounced me off, like a stone skipping over water. The scenes are too short, the music never stops, there are too many characters, we're always changing time and place, I'm not really sure what's happening, famous faces keep popping up. And I don't understand why everything is so frantic.Once we get to about the halfway mark, and the Trinity project gets that infamous test, the movie sinks in a little. That's because Nolan finally slows things down, lets us exist somewhere in the film for a moment, lets us be immersed.After that, for the most part, he's back a it, whisking us from one quick scene to the next at a pace that tries so hard to be breathless and exciting and just ends up distracting and frustrating. Still, I felt more in tune for the second half of the film, because I could now sense the dilemma, the emotional conflict in Oppenheimer after Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In one of the best scenes in the film, Oppenheimer is giving a speech to toast the success of the American empire, but the room turns white, and rumbles, and woman's skin flays.And finally, another scene with Emily Blunt, as Kitty Oppenheimer, giving one of those wolf pack prosecutors a piece of her mind in the closed hearing, really steals the show. Blunt was truly an enjoyable part of this movie, though she had little screen time.There's not much else to say. I feel like I just listened to some hyperactive child try to tell me a story that I thought I already knew, but became unnecessarily convoluted in the telling. I didn't really learn anything new, not about the physics of the A-Bomb, nor did I really get a sense of the McCarthyism of the era; they were just after Oppenheimer for no real reason I could grasp, until very close to the end, apparently it was all because he had some reservations about using the H-Bomb.Nolan tries a twist, too, holding back on a brief conversation between Oppenheimer and Einstein by a pond. Because several of Nolan's films have had a big twist, this one felt kind of paltry as twists go, but drove home the underlying grief and sadness of the whole A-Bomb project, and what it meant for the world.6.5/10.",Oppenheimer
6.0,"Barbie it's interesting, confusing, and a lot of fun",felipedesouzarosa,24 July 2023,"Barbie is a curious film, and I believe that the high expectations of the general public led to its performance being considered average. The film tries to criticize several things at the same time , criticizing how society puts pressure on women and reflections on self-knowledge, besides that, I assume that at some point someone wanted to criticize large corporations, but all of this gets lost in development and becomes confusing and often it's not clear what the movie really wants to be about, maybe focusing on just one thing or working them all properly would be better. Anyway, the film is fun and manages to get some very loud laughs, and unfortunately this script problem persists in situations that just happen without any development or reason, I hope that in a future sequel this is better worked on.",Barbie
7.0,What Walt's Watching,waltermwilliams,20 July 2023,"""Barbie"" the movie must be a dream come true for girls all over the world and some guys too if that's your jam.I know my daughter treasured her Barbie collection into adulthood and thought this was in her own words the ""Best Movie Ever""!The film opens with a brilliant parody to Stanley Kubrick's Sci-Fi Epic ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968).Margot Robbie stars as ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and believe me she ain't the only Barbie in this Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy with very adult themes You will laugh out loud at the clever script from Director Greta Gerwig and co-writer Noah Baumbach.Clearly they have done their research with every Barbie ever made and even some discontinued ones making an appearance, and of course all the accessories sold separately.The only one missing is ""Trixie Mattel"", based on the Drag Queen of the same name.America Ferrera shines like a diamond as ""Gloria"", one of the real humans who makes the journey to mythical Barbie Land after Barbie has an existential crisis and thinks about death.As a grown, smart, sophisticated woman she delivers one of the best soliloquy's ever in a movie.Will Ferrell on the hand as the ""Mattel CEO"" didn't meet the brief.I think the role required someone more grounded who you could believe as they make the transition of discovery to this Fantasy Land where only Barbies, Kens and one Allan exist.While Ryan Gosling is the key ""Ken"" based on Sun Lovin' Malibu Ken (1979), Simu Liu (""Kim's Convenience"", ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"") is one of the many other Ken's that populate this imaginary place of ""Kendom"" where their one and only job is to ""Beach"", but don't mistake them for lifesavers.Rhea Perlman (""Cheers"") has only 2 scenes as someone pivotal in the success of Barbies since 1959.Watch out for: ""Weird Barbie"" (other Barbies call her that behind her back and to her face) suitably played by Kate McKinnon and Michael Cera as ""Allan"". He really does fit into Ken's clothes.Plus the Pink Barbie Corvette and Caravan are stuff you'll want to take home with you.What I loved: The plethora of Barbies (including the deleted ones) and all the various Kens (don't forget John Cena as Merman Ken) Listen for: Dame Helen Mirren's hilarious narration that breaks the fourth wall.The Production Design is so elaborate that you'll want to explore ""Barbie Land"" in more detail using the pause button when this Big Screen flick moves to BluRay and Streaming.The movie features a contemporary soundtrack that includes a nod to Aqua's ""Barbie Girl"".Unfortunately the Third Act lets down the movie.On the way to its denouement ""Barbie"" turns into ""Barbie the Musical""with more singing and dancing than ""La La Land"" in the ""Beach Off"".""Barbie"" she's everything. He's just Ken.If you're a Barbie Girl in a Barbie World then come on to see ""Barbie"". Wear your best pink outfit, let's go party!",Barbie

8.0,Technically superb but...,leestoych,22 July 2023,"At its core Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. The haunting score by Ludwig Göransson is one of the film's most profound highlights. The score acts as its own character in how it builds and arcs throughout the film and peaks during arguably the best moment, the bomb drop. Paired with an aggressive and bold sound design that transports you into the screen, both sound aspects make this film truly remarkable.There are no faults in the incredible acting of the monumental cast in Oppenheimer. Murphy plays Oppenheimer in a way that enables the audience to feel the gravity of his situation and the historical repercussions that follow. However, Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss, is arguably the best the Oppenheimer cast brings. Downey Jr perfectly portrays the slow spiral and eventual downfall of his character.The film shines when it shifts into a more psychological element focusing on Oppenheimer and the impact of his actions and their effect on his person. The scene in the small theatre, when he gives the speech on the success of the bomb, is easily one of the film's most haunting and gut-wrenching moments.I wish there were more moments like that...If the film had followed this psychological approach more closely, engagement levels would have been higher, making the run time feel considerably shorter. However, the third act and its portrayal of Oppenheimer as the political 'scapegoat' is done well; this is when we see the other actors shine.However, Oppenheimer has its flaws. The non-linear timeline, used abundantly by Nolan, sometimes struggles with its fast-paced switching. The overload of characters being interviewed, heavy dialogue and the constant time changes does at the time make it difficult to follow the political aspect of the story. Engagement levels during the first and last acts were low, making the story feel dull and sluggish. As stated before, if the script studied the immense impact of this event on Oppenheimer and his family on a psychological level would have helped the meandering political story flow more smoothly. And yes, the three-hour run time could have definitely been cut by at least 15-30min.To summarise, Oppenheimer is a technical masterpiece. Sound design, soundtrack, cinematography and acting are at the peak of their game. It portrays the political impact that the creation of the atomic bomb had on America and the world. However, its pacing issues, extended run time, and heavy political agenda that steer us away from the effects on Oppenheimer himself provide problems in an otherwise strong film.8.4/10.",Oppenheimer

10.0,"Now I am become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds.",rayanenaffati,19 July 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" by Christopher Nolan is a film that delves deep into the consequences of the atomic bomb, focusing on Oppenheimer's perspective. This film requires a genuine passion for physics or history to fully appreciate its subtleties and biographical content.The imagery of the various explosions, accompanied by carefully orchestrated music and sound effects, creates an intense visual and auditory experience. At times, they even evoke feelings of tension and stress, enhancing the viewer's immersion in the story.The performances by the actors are remarkable, especially Cillian Murphy's brilliant portrayal of Oppenheimer. His captivating and nuanced interpretation brings this complex character to life, while Matt Damon, in the role of General Groves, delivers a solid and convincing presence.The film skillfully explores different temporal tones, offering a non-linear narrative that adds an additional depth to the story. The smooth transitions between color and black-and-white sequences add an artistic and symbolic dimension to the overall experience. These aesthetic choices enhance the emotional impact of the narrative and clearly distinguish the different eras and events.It's worth noting that to fully appreciate this film, prior interest in the history of the atomic bomb, as well as Oppenheimer's life and work, is necessary. With a duration of three hours, the film may seem lengthy to those who are not invested in these specific subjects.The story is divided into three distinct parts, with the first two closely interconnected. The first part focuses on Oppenheimer's training as a physicist, highlighting his interactions with Heisenberg and other eminent scientists of the time. The second part centers around the creation of the atomic bomb, the tests conducted at Los Alamos, and the scientific challenges faced by the team. The final part of the film focuses on Oppenheimer's hearing, where certain high-ranking officials, envious of his accomplishments, attempt to discredit him by presenting him as a spy working for the Soviets.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a film that delves deep into the history of the atomic bomb, offering remarkable performances, impressive visuals, and complex storytelling. It is an immersive cinematic experience that reveals the moral, scientific, and historical aspects of this pivotal event in our history.Special mention goes to the fantastic Gary Oldman, who is completely unrecognizable in the role of President Truman.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Great movie! Plot issues..but it's a movie about barbies,wknrxjy,27 July 2023,"""Barbie,"" the film, is an enchanting cinematic experience that is sure to entertain viewers of all ages. It's a vibrant and delightful exploration into the world of one of the most enduring and iconic dolls ever created. Its storyline is compelling and keeps you engaged throughout, making it a truly wonderful movie.What makes the movie stand out is its successful use of humor and adventure that ensures it isn't just another kids movie, but a family affair where adults can also derive enjoyment. Furthermore, the movie is brimming with fun characters that each add a unique flair to the narrative.A major highlight of the film is the character of Ken. He isn't merely a supporting role, but emerges as a real scene-stealer. Ken's charisma and witty dialogue delivery is splendid, adding a new layer to his character that audiences are sure to appreciate. His performance has a certain charm that makes you look forward to his scenes. Indeed, he truly stole the show.Despite the largely engaging narrative, the movie does come with a few plot holes. At times, the story lacks logic, and there are certain developments that seem a bit rushed or inadequately explained. However, considering that the movie is based on the universe of Barbie, where the rules of reality are often bent, these plot holes can be somewhat expected and forgivable.In conclusion, ""Barbie"" is an entertaining and heartwarming film that successfully captures the essence of its source material. Its flaws are minor and largely overshadowed by its vibrant characters, engaging narrative, and a particularly standout performance by Ken. Even with some plot holes, it's a cinematic treat that offers plenty of enjoyment for both kids and adults.",Barbie
10.0,"Fun, unforgetable movie",tamara82936382936739272739927373,19 July 2023,"This is the best movie I've seen in last 5 years. It's fun from beginning till the end. It is just what you would expect from a barbie movie, but it's also so much more. The plot is excellent, there is a lot of cool cameos and there is a new surprise in every second of the movie. It's unpredictable, so funny and it's also kind of deep. Would recommend 10/10.",Barbie
8.0,More Than Meets The Eye,bankofmarquis,21 July 2023,"The Margot Robbie/Ryan Gosling curiosity BARBIE is a subversive film. This Greta Gerwig directed move lures you in by presenting a farcical/satirical look at the pastel colored ""Barbieland"" and the myriad of outfits and ""golly-gosh"" goodness of the world of this iconic Mattel doll (and her boyfriend, Ken). Once you are comfortably settled into this world, you are transformed to the ""real world"" and the much deeper themes of a women's place in a patriarchal world.As another toy's slogan puts it, ""there's more than meets the eye"" to this film.And one should have expected something more than just a ""surfacey-fun"" film from the Writer/Director of such fare as LADYBIRD and FRANCES HA. Gerwing uses the stereotypes of Barbie and Ken to take a look at our society and the inherent hierarchy of the sexes while peeling back the layers of the key players to make them more than the plastic dolls they portray.And...it works surprisingly well for adults - not so much for kids.Margot Robbie, of course, is perfectly cast as the titular Barbie. She has the looks and the vacuous devil-may-care attitude of ""Stereotype Barbie"" and is a comfortable, pleasing entity to share this adventure with. But, with Gerwig's direction, Robbie's performance reveals, subtly, layer after layer until - at the end - we end up with a full fledged character and not just a living doll.Ryan Gosling is just as strong as Barbie's counterpart, Ken. He morphs from a Barbie worshipping boyfriend to something else once he encounters the real, male-dominated world. The BankofMarquis wondered why Gosling would agree to do a film that, on it's surface, appears to be a one-note joke-fest, but once the film really drives to it's point, one can see why Gosling agreed to be in this.Issa Rae, Kate McKinnon, Simu Liu, Michael Cerra, Helen Mirren (as the narrator) and America Ferrara all spark - at times - during this film while it was good to see Rhea Perlman (Carla on CHEERS) have a role that she could sink her teeth into.Only Will Ferrell - as the money hungry CEO of Mattel - falls short of interesting. His character - one of the only ""real world"" characters in this film - stays stereotypical throughout the movie. He is the only complete caricature in this film...and perhaps that is on purpose.Credit for the surprising depth of this film goes to Gerwig who brings her sensibilities to this film to make a comment on our society. It's a bold move by Gerwig and works well...unless you are a Mom that is bringing your 5 or 6 year old child to this film.And, that is the caution to this movie. It's not, necessarily, made for the youngsters that play with Barbies. The kids will love the early going of this film, but the more adult themes in the middle of the movie will probably make a good deal of them squirm in their seats, since these moments of depth will go over their heads.A surprisingly fun...and deeper than it appears to be....film, this Barbie is a multi-level dreamhouse.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the BankofMarquis.",Barbie
1.0,The HYPE is not real,sophiaaven,26 July 2023,"It was sooo boring, I could have left in the middle of the film and not care less about what was happening to the characters. I love the cast but everything was soo unfunny. I left the movie fealing like I learned nothing knew. The movie is trying to be this inclusive thing but with all the jokes directing into the old steriotypes it contradicted its self the hold time. Margot is beyond beautiful and calling her self ugly in the movie even though she is ""The Barbie"" isn't so clevver as they think it is, not even with the narrator. I Love Greta but it dosen't feel like her. Kinda like with Wednesday not feeling like a Tim Burton thing. But good job with the marketing, it got me.",Barbie
9.0,Beautiful film,santinogiovannetti,21 July 2023,"From the direction of Christopher Nolan. To the amazing soundtrack that makes every intense scene get you on the edge of your seat. To the beautiful acting of Cillian Murphy, and Robert Downey Jr., and Matt Damon, and Emily Blunt, and so many more. When I went to the theater watching this film, I thought in the back of my head that I knew the story and I knew the outcome. But Christopher Nolan still manages to dive deep down in reveal the story in ways I never thought. It's gonna be one of the best movies for a very long time. The only thing I can say is go out watch this movie. And do not miss a second of it because every scene and every word spoken matters. I can't wait to see what Christopher Nolan cooks up next!",Oppenheimer
10.0,A Masterpiece of Effortless Acting,naufalnp-51438,21 July 2023,"In the realm of cinematic brilliance, few films can boast a roster as astounding as Oppenheimer. Directed by the visionary Nolan, this movie is an absolute treat for cinephiles, but not for casual viewer. But what sets this film apart from the rest is the awe-inspiring performances by a multitude of S-class actors, who deliver their roles with such astonishing realism that it's hard to believe they are merely ""acting.""The storyline revolves around a gripping tale of love, loss, betrayal and redemption, set against the backdrop of World War II. However, it's the actors' performances that truly elevate this film into a realm of its own. Each S-class actor seamlessly becomes their character, breathing life into them with such profound authenticity that the audience is transported into their world.Leading the pack is the incomparable Cillian Murphy, who portrays a brilliant theoretical physicist who was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapons and then finds himself torn between two conflicting paths. His journey leads him to a pivotal moment that demands an excruciating moral decision, one that can alter the course of not only his life but also the lives of those he cares about. His portrayal is nothing short of breathtaking; every subtle emotion is conveyed through a single glance or a quiver in his voice. It's as if he is genuinely experiencing the turmoil of his character, leaving the audience completely engrossed in his journey.",Oppenheimer
7.0,Stereotypical Barbie becomes a martyr for DEI Barbieland,Airman87,21 July 2023,"When things start going awry in Barbieland, it is up to 'stereotypical Barbie' (blonde hair, blue eyed version) to reset the matriarchal pieces in the perfect plastic world that represents everyone equally...or slightly less equal (if inverse to reality were offsetting). While Robbie is an idealistic Barbie, Gosling's charismatic nature completely directs attention away from Margot anytime the two share frame - it really does become the Ken movie for much of the second act as Gosling's character dominates the screen.Of course, this is all the plot oversimplified to its core. The moments of unabashed humor, and there is lots of it, speak for Gerwig's witted personality...unfortunately the preachy tone carried throughout the movie also does too. The film has its moments, even if the ending leaves some viewers indifferent. It's probably worth the watch if you just want a few chuckles and nothing more.",Barbie
10.0,It's Barbie,zwbnmzrqk,21 July 2023,I never cared for Barbie but the movie is really good I think the casting is perfect and the music and who they got to do the soundtrack I also love how they made the Barbie world a separate land and it was brighter then the whole world and I love how they went to the Mattel head quarters and the people trying to take her away and Barbie and Ken being in the real In the real world also the marketing team did amazing on the promo and advertisement on the movie with all the company's collab with Barbie and etc so overall the Barbie movie got a lot of hype and well deserved excellent film and amazing for people who love barbie.,Barbie
10.0,Cinema,NS-movie-reviews,29 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan is a savant of filmmaking. Cillian Murphy SHINES in this movie. They are one absolutely amazing duo. Not to mention a strong supporting cast around them and.""Oppenheimer"" is jam packed with information and begging to be watched 2, 3, 4 times. I walked out of the theater ready to watch it again already. It is fascinating and engages you the entire time you're watching.All of the performances by everyone involved bring the story to life to its fullest potential. They showed up and absolutely showed out on screen for this historical retelling: honestly a masterpiece. 1000% worth watching in theaters if you can.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Probably the most complex film I saw in a theatre,arvyis,21 July 2023,"What can I say, this goes together with movies like Tree of life, Melancholia, Inception, Blade runner 2049. When the movie stays with you after you walked out from the theatre.Despite being very dialogue heavy, I was drawn to the screen almost for the whole time. Amazing cast, with great supporting actors. Amazing character play by Cillian Murphy.Also I think movie has a very strong idea, it is a man who brought the capability for humans to destroy themselves.We see the genius who gradually realises the impact of his work and that he is no longer can stop it. A chain reaction.Arguably best Nolan movie to date.",Oppenheimer
10.0,In Awe,colbiroy,24 July 2023,"I love Greta Gerwig so I knew I'd love this. It, however, exceeded my expectations and was a movie so great it broke through my expectations and my version of the real world. I will see this again as many times and with as many people or by myself that I can. This is one of the greatest films not only of the year, but of the decade, if not the century. If I sound like I'm over exaggerating it, for me, I am completely serious. Please go watch it with your mom, your dad, your lover, your sister, your brother, your best friend, or your worst enemy. It's worth it, it really really is. Bravo!!!!!!!",Barbie
10.0,Oppenheimer Will Win it All,stdoar,26 July 2023,"This. Will. Win. Everything. Under. The. Sun. Whether all the credit goes to Cillian Murphy's brillance or to Nolan for tapping Cillian, we may never know. But both combine for something that will go unmatched for a long time. An honest biopic about Robert Oppenheimer that doesn't provide any answers because there are no easy answers. Instead, it lends to the audience a masterwork of a story worth pondering over & over. This goes above Nolan's past best works in Dunkirk and Inception, not only due to the refined wizardry of Nolan's genius but also to the nature of what the film sets out to explore -- that momentous juncture in human history when we couldn't mathmatically rule out that we, as humanity, could destroy ourselves in the very attempt to save ourselves--with all of our human complexicites webbed throughout.",Oppenheimer
10.0,So beautiful!,fidiascuriel,21 July 2023,"This movie was so emotionally moving in a way that I didn't expect at all. I loved how critically it evolves around the Barbie and Ken figure and questions everything you ever took for granted in a very nice and intelligent way. I absolutely loved this movie and would watch it again any time.I sobbed for most half of the movie, at the end it comes down to why it's important to be a human and not trying to be perfect.The cast was also amazing. Great acting. Almost all of the cast of sex education is in it which was really cool to see. I would totally recommend this movie to anyone, even if you don't like or didn't play with Barbie.",Barbie
3.0,A hodgepodge of confusion,shahzaibh,24 July 2023,"Oppenheimer from which I had expectations and waited for so long was more a documentary. 1/3rd black and white 1/3rd historical facts and 1/3rd indecipherable wannabe movie making trying to give it a drama masterpiece look. Movie lovers think it was a documentary, documentary lovers think it was a movie. In my opinion total hodgepodge to confuse but would definitely break the bank. Acting was weak, even though resemblances matter but poor acting would only earn and not be long lasting as a movie to be reckoned with. In short a documovie would be the right word instead of entertainment. A solid 3/10 from me.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Perfect,ipsentorres,22 July 2023,"This movie is for audience can always know about it. There some good stuff and more, so we can see about the good movie. I know this movie has good things or bad things, which it is the good thing about the project and a lot stuff. So i did great for the movie. Always know this movie, but there's no problem unless the audience are did good or awesome. Oppenheimer is the good movie. But there's don't allow at school only cuz it is for Mature audience. The sexuality and nudity are good and moderate. Which there's no full frontal nudity or any graphic. Don't worry it also may profanity are good. :)",Oppenheimer
10.0,Christopher Nolan dropped an ATOM BOMB,rabiislam-50713,27 July 2023,"Watched Oppenheimer. Absolute spectacle fit for watching on a big screen. The whole cast was perfect. Cillian Murphy gives the performance of his career. A shoe in for his first Oscar. Watching RDJ on screen was Cherry on the top, Oscar on the way for him too. Emily Blunt did a fantastic job too.Light travels faster than sound. Mr. Nolan not only made a terrific bomb explosion scene but also he followed the science for the speed of light and sound here. Quite possibly Christopher Nolan's tightest screenplay till date. Top notch BGM, spectacular visuals and Cris Nolan's special nonlinear story telling overall Christopher Nolan dropped an ATOM BOMB.",Oppenheimer
1.0,So so bad,oscarcalusi-94143,25 July 2023,"Great story. Great expectations . Awful cinematography. Badly told story. The interesting and important parts interrupted by endless awful music and loud pointless explosions and noises interrupting the dialog which would've made the movie good. To much going on at once in an uncontrolled chaos of epileptic visual display . The music for this movie was incredibly poor. Any part of the movie that I can think of , be that visual sound or story , was always eclipsed by unexplained chaotic take over by something else. If it's a story then music. If it's a scenery then epileptic display. Never thought I'll make it though. Bad experience.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Just wow,joaquimgsc,26 July 2023,"Today i watched Oppenheimer in Imax and in all honesty, it's the best movie i have ever seen. Before going today i isolated myself from every Oppenheimer content just because i wanted to be blown away by Nolan and his amazing cast and im so thankful that i managed to dodge spoilers and etc because after leaving the cinema i felt different and moved by the story. I cant exactly explain what this feeling is but i was not the same person that entered the movie theatre. Oppenheimer is a piece of art that you dont only see or observe, you experience it with your entire body and you spend the entire 3 hours on the edge of your seat with your heart pumping harder and harder as the movie progresses. I never felt anything like this before, not even in real life, i remained glued to my seat for the entire movie and i even forgot about eating my popcorn due to this extreme immersion that the director orchestrated. I wish i could erase Oppenheimer from my memory just so i can go and experience it again, in order to feel all of these emotions and feelings thats this masterpiece has to offer. I also gotta talk about the score of this movie and Ludwig Goransson delivers the most perfect soundtrack possible. This score is chilling, epic, beautiful and touching, making it one of the core aspects for immersion and it also builds up anxiety and terror inside the audience, enhancing the greatness of the story itself. The whole sound department did an extraordinary job in this film, it was all just perfect and fitting for the story. Cillian Murphy performs his best role to date as J Robert Oppenheimer and i really dont think anyone would do such an extraordinary job like Cillian did. Cristopher Nolan chose a brilliant cast and they delivered beyond expectations, every single one of them. In my opinion, Nolan and Cillian Murphy deserve the best movie and best actor oscars, respectively, without any contest and even Robert Downey Junior is a contestor for best supporting actor. As i said before, this experience changes you and your worldview is a different one compared to the one you had 3 hours ago and im just so glad that i got the opportunity to watch Nolans, and possibly cinema's best work of all time. Yeah i do recommend the filme its neat.",Oppenheimer
6.0,Just a little empty,agjbull,23 July 2023,"I really wanted to enjoy this and I know that I am not the target audience but there were massive plot holes and no real flow. The film was very disjointed. Ryan Gosling as good as he is seemed to old to play Ken and Will Ferrell ruined every scene he was in. I just didn't get it, it seemed hollow artificial and hackneyed. A waste of some great talent. It was predictable without being reassuring and trying so hard to be woke in the most superficial way in that but trying to tick so many boxes it actually ticked none. Margo Robbie looks beautiful throughout, the costumes and the sets were amazing but the story was way too weak and didn't make much sense at all.",Barbie
2.0,Bitter sweet movie,olgakastritsi-81359,22 July 2023,"Firstly I'll say that I'm the movie's target audience: a female in her 20s. Even though the movie touched some subjects like the fact that a lot of girls grew up with Barbies and felt very insecure about their bodies (which I 100% agree with), and the right to choose what you want to be in your life, it felt uncomfortable; it felt as if all men in the movie were emasculated. In the world of barbie all Kens were uncomfortably stupid and only served for comedic purposes. I won't give spoilers but in this ""perfect"" barbie world you would expect that they would achieve true gender equality since not only Barbie but the Ken dolls are also doctors, scientists, politicians etc etc.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling went above and beyond; I enjoyed their performances. Some scenes were also very funny but personally I did not like the ending.",Barbie
1.0,Tedious and ungripping garbage,cameronmeegan,22 July 2023,"I fed into all of the hype and was extremely excited to watch this film. I will never get these 3 hours of my life back. In my opinion there was only one good scene and that was the explosion. The rest of the film is a convoluted mess with all the characters shaping up to be completely uninteresting(except for Oppenheimer himself) The acting was rather good but it doesn't matter when the characters are uninteresting. I've seen many movies and I think this takes the cake for the movie that was the least gripping/entertaining. How can you be expected to pay attention to a 3 hour dialogue slog of a movie when you can barely hear the actors talking? I don't think it was a theatre issue but if it was I apologize. The film is only good for about 10 mins, 1/10 should have seen Barbie.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Thought-provoking film,deckkerdinesh,22 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that delves into the complex life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the renowned physicist often referred to as ""the father of the atomic bomb."" This haunting and thought-provoking film masterfully captures a pivotal shift in human consciousness over the course of three gripping hours. As a drama that explores the themes of genius, hubris, and the consequences of individual and collective errors, it immerses viewers in the turbulent journey of Oppenheimer, whose research and development of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki forever changed the world.",Oppenheimer

10.0,Oppenheimer Review,bradykitchen-33648,24 July 2023,"This is my most anticipated film of 2023 for a single reason and that reason is Christopher Nolan. He is easily my favorite director and when I saw the first trailer for this film I was stunned. I have not seen many new releases this year but from what I have seen this film is the best by far and when Oscar season rolls around this is going to win everything.Christopher Nolan direction is phenomenal and that fact that he said he used zero CGI is a monumental achievement. The visuals in this film are phenomenal and they need to be seen on the biggest screen you can find to thoroughly understand how great they are.This is the best all around cast I have seen in a while. Every single person brought they're A game and I could see multiple people picking up nominations and possibly a couple of wins. Cillian Murphy, oh my god, if this guy doesn't win best actor I will be shocked. This in my opinion is his best performance and possibly the best performance of the decade so far. But he is not the only stud in this film Robert Downey Jr. Was phenomenal as well, and could very easily get a win for best supporting actor. The rest of the cast was incredible, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and more all do amazing jobs.The story is emotional, impactful, and extremely well executed. The score is beyond phenomenal. Everything in this film screams give me an award, and I cannot wait for this to receive the praise it deserves.A+",Oppenheimer
6.0,Not so unique as expected,dreopdreef,19 July 2023,"The concept of a Barbie movie is really unique and got me all exited. But unfortunately to me it delivers the same messages that we keep hearing as of lately.It started off quite funny, but after 45 minutes or so, the movie went in a direction I did not like. It took itself a bit too serious. I would have preferred a more lighthearted movie.Ryan Gosling did the best job out of everyone playing Ken I thought. The perfect guy with the perfect body and yet very campy, girly and insecure. Job well done, especially toward the end.If you are a fan of Barbie, you will probably get your money's worth.",Barbie
10.0,The magical connection between human imagination in the life of a conscious doll!,iyahikhalil,21 July 2023,"Barbie was a big surprise for me, I enjoyed every sip of this delicious pink drink that teleports you to a bright world where imagination is real and reality is just a tiny dreamland nowhere and everywhere. The production design was out of this world and the casting of this movie was perfect, every frame was shot and directed beautifully, in general, the technical aspect was brilliant. Still what impressed me the most was the writing! Greta and Noah wrote a masterpiece film that explores while criticizing the good, the bad, and the ugly in the flaws of human nature in the eyes of Barbie and Kent in their fun adventure in the real world and the imaginary one. What was outstanding in this fun ride is the ability to combine all these meaningful feelings and emotions in one movie in a light sarcastic theme and not forget to present the real issues in our world nowadays and the conflict while analyzing the diverse ideologies that clash in this mess, all of this was done through an objective talented lens.",Barbie
8.0,It's a good movie,qnzmnjkq,26 July 2023,"It's a good movie. Walking out of it I knew people wouldn't like it considering we rarely have a women's actual point of view in cinema. It's actually quite funny seeing people's reactions to it as if everything that we were showed in the 2 hours of the movie isn't true.In my viewing people were clapping, laughing and crying. It's touching and I'm sure many will relate wether people want to admit to it or not. (This movie isn't about a perfect doll)That being said if you don't like musicals you might not love this movie there are quite a few numbers in this film. Not bad ones just some are abit longer than I'd like.Overall I'd watch again and I've never actually owned a Barbie 👍🏼",Barbie
8.0,Let's Go Party With Barbie,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,22 July 2023,"Welcome back, Streamers! The most anticipated movie weekend of 2023 is here. It's Barbenheimer. If you haven't followed it, there's this ridiculous internet debate over which film will reign supreme between Greta Gerwig's Barbie and Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer...In this corner, coming in at 11.5 inches, it's the iconic, blonde fashion doll, Barbie.Barbie is the first live-action film about the American icon and her place in culture. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach wrote a screenplay, which Gerwig directs, that takes audiences into Barbieland, where we meet stereotypical Barbie (Marot Robbie) and her fellow Barbies living their perfect existences until one day stereotypical Barbie starts to think constantly about death, her feet become flat and other things are off. Barbie has to make a trek to the real world to find out why things have changed for her and to set them straight. Barbie is accompanied by Ken (Ryan Gosling), whose existence is so dependent upon Barbie that he only has a good day if Barbie looks at him. Rollerblading, hot pink singing and dancing hijinks ensue.Overall, Barbie is a weird and wonderful movie. It is clear that a lot of thought and money went into creating this story and world inhabited by Barbie. You will be awed by the clever production design and the intense attention to detail that went into constructing Barbieland. The colors pop. There are cute animated touches throughout. Additionally, the costume design enhances each Barbie and Ken in interesting ways. You'll also notice the music throughout the film is sometimes poignant and sometimes hilarious, especially when it involves the Kens. From top to bottom, the crafts in this movie are top notch and worthy of a trip to the big screen.The cast, especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, are excellent. Robbie brings sensitivity and heart to Barbie. She's thoughtful and kind while also being naive and troubled by her own existence. It is a tricky performance to pull off and Robbie is great. Ken is an iconic performance for Gosling. He pulls out all of the stops to bring Ken to life. I can't imagine another actor being as successful in this role. Gosling is a really gifted comedic actor as evidenced by this performance. I'll also note that Kate McKinnon, American Ferrar, Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir, Michael Cera and Issa Rae each have good moments as well. It's a big cast, but some of the smaller roles do get chances to shine.The main issue is that the messaging is so heavy-handed. There is a lot to unpack about Barbie's place in society. What does she represent to women and girls? What does she represent to men? There are themes of feminism, patriarchy, and corporate greed. The film does its best to address its issues in a clever and subversive way, but it veers into becoming patronizing at times rather than funny and satirical. The performances of the actors really carry the film across the finish line despite how it handles its themes.Ultimately, Barbie is a movie worthy of a trip to the theater. It is funny and even clever at times. The messaging of the movie gets heavy-handed and some of the subversive fun is lost in those moments. Nevertheless, Gosling and Robbie fully commit to their characters as does the large ensemble; and the production design and music are top notch. You won't be disappointed with a big box of popcorn. You decide if you want to wear hot pink like everyone else.",Barbie
4.0,"A bloated, celebrity whack a mole of a movie",BellaBella78,28 July 2023,"2 hours of bloated, dull storytelling with one hour of decent story. So many celebrity cameos that it was distracting and took you out of the story every time. Everyone clearly wants the chance to cameo in a Nolan film.Nolan needs a hard edit. 3 hours of time I'll never get back. There is a trend of these self important movies thst don't know quite where to find the story.For all the men claiming that barbie wasn't kind enough to men, there's plenty here for you.

And margot robbie come on... the perfect casting for Barbie. I also have to say, the way they created Barbie land was so amazing, it just makes you just want to there. I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie. I can understand not everyone will love it. But i am sure it is a iconic film already.",Barbie
10.0,"This is the best movie I have ever seen. Nothing to say, it's great.",tharamovies,22 July 2023,"Very different than Nolan's recent films, especially the Sci-Fi ones, but shows that Nolan can master the Biopic/Drama genre just as well as he can any other genre he tried to tackle yet.The film is 3-hours long but goes through very quickly and enjoyably. Without spoiling anything, the film presents important and very relevant subjects, and doing so while being non-stop entertainment and a comprehensive character study and a study of our society on a very high pace.Without mentioning anything specific, there was one scene that caused almost every single person in the theatre to move nervously in the seats, non-stop for a long period of time, being one of the most intense scenes I ever watched in a movie and reminding me of the true power of the cinematic experience like no other movie did in recent years.The year is only half-way through but right now this is my top pick for the upcoming awards season. Picture, Writing, Directing, Acting, Score-- Oppenheimer is a winner on all fronts. A rare feat for filmmaking and a salient reminder that cinema is not dead.I highly recommend this film to everyone. Watched it once already, and going back to the theatre for at least a few more times soon.",Oppenheimer
10.0,"""Oppenheimer"" - An Atomic Blend of Intensity and Genius",andrijadjuric,22 July 2023,"""Oppenheimer,"" the latest venture by auteur Christopher Nolan, is a cinematic tour de force that masterfully fuses historical gravitas with human drama. It delves into the paradoxical world of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist known as the 'father of the atomic bomb,' giving us a potent exploration of one man's ambition, guilt, and the cataclysmic power of science.As with all Nolan's films, ""Oppenheimer"" showcases an impeccably tight narrative that transcends linear storytelling. Every scene is intricately woven, each a revelation of character and event, slowly building an intense crescendo that is both chilling and mesmerizing. The multi-layered plot cleverly navigates the dilemmas faced by Oppenheimer, skillfully juxtaposing the scientific thrill of discovery with the devastating human consequences of his creation.The visual effects are, quite simply, breathtaking. Nolan brings to life the mid-20th century world of theoretical physics and wartime America with an awe-inspiring sense of realism. The climax, featuring the detonation of the atomic bomb, is a cinematic spectacle unlike any other, a poignant reminder of the destructive force humanity has unlocked.The ensemble cast delivers exceptional performances. The portrayal of Oppenheimer is nothing short of riveting - a man torn between his duty, curiosity, and the moral implications of his groundbreaking work. The nuances in his character are effectively and heart-wrenchingly conveyed, anchoring the audience in his complex emotional journey.Hans Zimmer's score, a character in itself, perfectly complements the atmospheric tension of the film. His haunting melodies add another layer of complexity to the scenes, mirroring Oppenheimer's own crescendoing turmoil and the world-changing events he set into motion.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a magnificent achievement. It's a film that successfully marries artistry with history, and personal introspection with global catastrophe. Nolan once again proves his ability to create intellectual, emotionally-resonant cinema that stays with viewers long after the end credits roll. This isn't just a film; it's an experience, a contemplation on the human condition, and a sobering reflection of our times.",Oppenheimer
9.0,WATCH IT!!!,ayeshamahmood-37260,26 July 2023,"I am jealous of anyone who got to see this masterpiece on an imax screen. It was simply outstanding, visual and score was phenomenal and the acting was top notch. The attention to detail was THERE, this has to be Nolan's best piece. I was not bored at any point throughout the 3hr film. I personally don't believe this is not my favourite Nolan's film (interstellar is) but this is definitely a close first. Before watching the film I would definitely would recommend to do a little research into Oppenheimers history as a lot of people did not understand the movie. Cillian murphy absolutely should get an Oscar for his performance in Oppenheimer.",Oppenheimer
3.0,A letdown,tar_smith,22 July 2023,"I was so excited to see this movie for months, even buying some of the merch and promotional products for it, but it turned out to be such a huge letdown. I was expecting it to be a fun, light-hearted, nostalgic movie similar to how the Super Mario movie was, but I left the theater pretty disappointed with Barbie. It does start off cute, but about halfway through the movie it gets very heavy handed with politics, and becomes a complete battle of the sexes. This lasts all the way until the end of the movie. The political messaging starts to become like beating a dead horse by the time the movie is over. What I thought was going to be a fun, relaxing night at the movies turned into what seemed like a political debate. Such a disappointment! I feel like there was so much potential for this to be such a great, fun movie, it really is a shame how it was turned into a battle of the sexes, women are perfect and can do no wrong while men are complete losers showdown. I am a woman myself, and all that political messaging in the movie was so unnecessary. It would have been completely fine to keep the messaging at how girls can grow up to do whatever career they want and they don't have to look a certain way to be beautiful, etc., but this movie was just too over the top with the messaging of women are perfect, women are better than men, etc. It was just all so unnecessary. I did give it a few points because there were a few funny parts in it, and the set was beautiful, but neither of those things could make up for how disappointing it turned out to be.",Barbie
8.0,Wanted to love it more,meisterfahrer,21 July 2023,"Brilliant acting all around. As an old Army Veteran I enjoyed Matt Damon as the General in charge and Oppie's confidant. The character development was wonderful including suspicious Teller and reliable friend Lawrence.Having watched the great msnbc documentary last week, I was in my mind expecting a more linear portrayal of the historic events and lead up. Perhaps there was a bit too much artistic license used here.The constant flashback scenes were difficult to follow - and I was focused. The use of color vs B&W didn't seem to have a pattern to timeframe or events. The music seemed too dominant while the dialogue was often hard to pickup and decipher (accents and jargon).The last hour seemed anti-climatic following the atomic bomb destruction, and it wasn't clear what RDJ's important Lewis Strauss character's motives were.But the most important parts of the story were presented directly - the initial exuberance of supporting their country in wartime, the brilliant planning and teamwork, the beautiful Los Alamos location, the unknowns of fusion and fission, and the realization that this terrible bomb would not prevent future wars - and the paranoia it set off vis a vis the ""communist threat"" were all wonderfully presented.I just feel like this important story would have benefitted by being told in a linear time fashion. A very relevant story in todays world - and Russia remains as the unpredictable bad character.",Oppenheimer
8.0,"Now I Am Become Death, the Destroyer of Worlds",jack_o_hasanov_imdb,29 July 2023,"This movie is one of the best movies of this year. I like C. Nolan. I also really liked this movie. The movie is told from Oppenheimer's point of view. I think it was fine. Some scientific topics were very difficult to understand for me. I think the bomb scene was good. I think the acting was very good. Cillian Murphy played the static, cold character very well. Robert Downey Jr. Played great too. I think tacting was generally so good. I think there were some boring scenes in the movie. There were scenes in the cinema where I started to sleep out of boredom. But overall, I think it deserves an ""8"" point. This movie is one of the best movies of this year. I like it. I also watched the other movie (pink movie) first. It was so good after that movie.",Oppenheimer
10.0,<3,gracecahill-08885,22 July 2023,"This movie was so perfect especially as someone who has grown up with Barbie and was in pure awe of her from birth to the age of 12. I was forced to grow up due to peer pressure when I hit twelve so bye bye Barbie. I always regretted doing that because I wasn't ready to say goodbye but everyone else my age was. It breaks my soul seeing young girls, younger than I was letting go of their childhood so quick, trying to keep up with the older teen trends. It breaks my soul because if I was one of those girls I would be crying for my Barbie while conforming to society. Gloria's speech absolutely rocked my world. I need that tattooed in my brain, Greta is an absolute inspiration to women and girls everywhere. One thing about Barbie is I would not have an education without her. When I started school I refused to do my work unless I was promised a Barbie when I returned home, and it worked. If Barbie had not inspired women so long ago, I would probably not have completed my education as I would have found there to be no point. One thing is that I am sad or is a Barbie movie for one reason only, men will not likely see this. My brother and dad had no interest in even looking at promotion or trailers, there is no way I can get them to see this masterpiece, and they NEED to see this it is so important. If there is one movie that can change the course of history it is this one, as the introduction of Barbie did. I'm so proud and excited for Greta Gerwig and what is to come. As a newly out of school 18 year old my passion is to become a director or an actress, and Greta's work delights me everyday because of Greta, I have a chance. Before Greta's movie, I actually never heard of a female director in film, so it never even came into my head as a possibility before Greta came in. This movie has come at a perfect time for me as I turned 18 last month so this is my kickstart to womanhood, and what a way to start. I ask every woman and girl to watch this and I ask them to drag whichever man in their lives that they can. This movie is the epitome of ""yes"" there are no other words to perfectly signify this. Now, after all the mushy stuff, the humour in this film was perfect, there was never a cringy joke moment unless it was intended that way, and they never put a joke in a bad place. I was slightly worried the album may overshadow the movie, but it was perfect, never took anything away from the movie. Ryan Gosling did a fantastic job because I really believed he was Ken, nothing in me could say ""yeah that's Ryan"". Margot did a superb performance of Barbie, it is hard to play a doll that is perfect yet is experiencing an existential crisis of emotion, she deserves more praise.",Barbie
10.0,Must see,BenjaminB1991,22 July 2023,"If you see one film this year, or this decade, let it be Oppenheimer. This is one of the greatest films of all of history. This is a deep film too. I am broke, taking money out of my IRA to pay a bit off of the credit cards in order to see this movie. I needed to see this film opening day in IMAX. I am glad I did. Very important film. It is rated R, but I would still recommend you see this movie with your older children supervised. That is if they are well behaved. This is a movie that you don't take a restroom break halfway during. Go before. Don't buy a large soda and popcorn. I never do anyway. But I sometimes buy a double Jack and Coke at AMC Theatres. But this film I decided not to get a drink. No distractions.",Oppenheimer
6.0,Outstanding but why nudity,maklava,24 July 2023,"Another Christopher Nolan masterpiece, as it started out, but was quickly changed the tone when nudity was added in for no real reason at all. It honestly took away from the overall character of the film and ruined getting a pg-13 rating which would have been able to be seen by even more fans. It felt like something added in by producers to get more views or add something spicy to the content. It film was unreal, the acting was amazing, and the overall feel of the movie was left confused by the length and seemed drawn out more than his other films. It could have been a hour cut off in just unneeded dialogue.",Oppenheimer

9.0,3 hours of sheer panic,eoinageary,23 July 2023,"So Oppenheimer is undoubtedly one of the most anticipated movies of the year by many people including myself, a Nolan epic people wait for and it delivers, not without some flaws but the types of flaws don't carry nearly as much weight as the positives.Oppenheimer is about a period in J Robert Oppenheimers life, gathering with some of the greatest minds in Physics, Oppenheimer must build a bomb for the US army so they can win world war 2. We get to see his personal life and the struggles of being one of the smartest men alive.I think the pacing for the first 2 hours was great, not a second felt dragged, we are constantly bouncing from one scene to the next, showcasing the internal panic of meeting his deadline and what it must be like being as fast paced within his mind.The score FANTASTIC, the cinematic shots are beautiful and that you expect, there are these shots of atoms and other forces at times when he speaks that we're so great.The supporting cast were all fantastic, so man amazing actors in this, Florence was okay, I found her purpose to the film was okay, her acting was fantastic, Matt Damon was great, showing his development to Opp, Emily blunts character had a nice arc within the movie, RDJ was fantastic and knowing nothing about Opps life made it sweeter as the movie went on, but Cillian was the man of the hour, FINALLY, he was incredible and held the movie on his shoulders, his emotions are great, his assurance and contemplation are fantastic scenes.The 3hr runtime was a little much as the last 40-1hr felt like it lost momentum, I loved the scenes but their pace made me lose the feeling I had for a long while, other than that, I loved it, not sure it I will rush to see it again but it's a fantastic movie, 8.5/10.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Oppenheimer,ETO_Buff,25 July 2023,"I didn't give it 10 stars because it jumps around a lot chronologically, which is a very annoying current trend in film making, and can be confusing even if one's a history buff. Also because in typical Hollywood bleeding-heart-liberal fashion, it talked more about the destruction wrought by the atomic bombs than it did about the hundreds of thousands of civilian Japanese lives that were saved because of the bombs.Other than that, the acting was excellent, which is to be expected from a cast with four Academy Award winners, a two-time Academy Award nominee, and a few BAFTA winners and nominees. The fX were spectacular as well.",Oppenheimer
10.0,"""I believe we did it""",jswtw,22 July 2023,"There is a moment. Right after the detonation. We see the horrific realisation on his face in a realm of silence. The pure form of terror in its most subtle form as he understands what he has done. And just for a moment you realise along with him that the world has been changed.When the final scene finished playing and the score came to its conclusion there was a brief period of stillness throughout the audience as everyone momentarily considered what they had just witnessed. And for the first time in my cinematic experience I was just lost for words. As everyone left their seats and my dad and my friend spoke to me I just sat there pondering the meaning of it all, barely replying. And then I realised myself that I'd never been affected by a film in that way before. There are those that I have enjoyed more than this, that have brought out more emotions in me and even those that I consider better made. But the visceral experience that was. It was just phenomenal.Perhaps I have been blown away to an extent that isn't widely felt. But I think that most of us can agree that Nolan has presented us with his masterpiece no matter how it compares to his previous filmography and what we prefer or not. By placing all the elements of this film together with all the hard work so many have put into it we have been delivered something of brilliance. A hauntingly beautiful score from Ludwig Göransson which gave me chills whenever it played that masterful crescendo of power. The incredible sound design that packs an almighty punch emphasising the true power behind these horrifying creations. The alluring cinematography of Hoyte van Hoytema suitably demonstrating both claustrophobic discomfort and breath-taking pictures of art. The screenplay exhibiting the true power of words both from those spoken by real life figures and Nolan's careful hand. The performances of the cast as a whole bringing these people to the big screen in fascinating ways but most notably of Cillian Murphy and his outstanding and without a doubt Oscar-worthy take on Oppenheimer and of Robert Downey Jr reaffirming his acting prowess in the portrayal of Lewis Strauss. And finally, the considerably fantastic direction of Christopher Nolan to administer this truly wonderful experience which somehow feels like a culmination of all his work that came before.I can't say it was without flaws unfortunately. I felt at points it became a little dragged out which took me out of the experience and the editing also felt a little too choppy to the point where it was hard to follow sometimes. However, the pacing may have been from my own fault of focusing too much on the adrenaline fuelled sequences of visceral sensation preventing me from admiring the significance of the sections of lower tempo and the editing was clearly deliberate to present the chaotic nature of the reality behind this complex period in modern history.I spent a few brief instances looking around at the audience And it reminded of my love of the cinematic world. The silence as everyone is completely immersed in what we are being shown. The impossible task of tearing your eyes from the screen. The pure engagement of this new world that you have been transported to. That is what film is about.But truly, above everything, despite any of my overall opinion of entertainment or issues with the film. It was one of the greatest filmic experiences I've had and I honestly just cannot decide on how I feel about it all. It has completely thrown me.There are numerous fantastic sequences within the film but the one that stood out to me was the ending. I will not unveil what it is or does but I was so overwhelmed with pure emotion that my eyes just glistened and a tear rolled down my cheek. With one final crescendo after all the symbolism, all the visual cues, all the foreshadowing, all the exploration of humanity, the consequence of action, the power of comradery, the fear of man. Nolan brings the hammer down with a consideration of reality and what we have done.And it is terrifying.",Oppenheimer

Margot Robbie is absolute perfection and Michael Cera's ""Allan"" is just hilarious. Not to mention the rest of the cast. It was surprisingly very touching, poignant, and extremely nostalgic. I mean they got everything perfect. Every touch of the playhouses, the outfits. I loved that the entire audience went dressed in pink. The little girl in me was *screaming*. Loved every single part of it. The Kens revolution and dance sequence are just so creative. I would watch this over and over. So thoughtful.",Barbie
6.0,"Clever, dazzling, but somewhat incoherent",bobyule,26 July 2023,"On the plus side, this was an ambitious, dazzling film with what I felt was an original concept. It explored the world of gender stereotyping and male-female relationships, using the world of Barbie and Ken as its base point. There was a strong feminist theme running through it, but I did not find this overwhelming. Whilst the male figures were often portrayed as stupid and one-dimensional, this was done with some wit and indeed affection.The action migrated between the real world and the mythical world of Barbie, and so perhaps it was no surprise that the plot tended to meander and remained unconvincing. The energy of the film was sustained by the comedy and the zaniness of the characters.I differ from some critics in that I thought the best performance came from Margot Robbie as Barbie. Her character bounced between parody and realism but she managed the demands well. I thought that the much acclaimed Ryan Gosling tended to over-act and his character became annoying.This may be down to my age and my Englishness, but I was unable to make out the detail of the many snappy one-liners that were delivered. The young and the American will probably not have this trouble.Though likeable and even moving in places, altogether this film felt like less than the sum of its parts. Its attempts at juggling comedy and serious themes, fantasy and reality, were not ultimately successful and it became incoherent and lacking in some kind of unity.Ultimately, for me, the acid test of a film is the issue of whether or when I start wanting it to end. I made to about two-thirds of the way through.",Barbie
10.0,Meaningful and interesting movie😋,t-65804,21 July 2023,"Barbie is a very good start movie-try to popularize the feminism idea to normal people. Many people just lack a point or we can say a chance to touch such idea. After watching this movie, I realized that men all over the world love to be fathers and love to preach. Women, as the party being objectified, are always in the status of the object being stared at. When I saw ""Let me show you"" in the movie theater, all the girls laughed, and this kind of resonance for a long time was very exciting lol. The biggest surprise was the tribute to 2001 at the beginning of the film, which I loved. It is a good moral that civilization evolves when all women wake up.",Barbie
7.0,So perfectly casted,Harlowwinslet-292-209346,20 July 2023,I'm so happy with the casting that I can look past some other issues. It wasn't as nostalgic as I would have wanted it to be but this is definitely a new generations barbie movie. It really checked all the boxes with me. Fun costumes and great performances. It was fantasy and also very real. I can't think of anyone that could ever be better as Barbie than Margot Robbie. This was the perfects storm and it was a long time coming. Greta Gerwig's directing was fun and the script was inspiring. This movie won't be for everyone for sure but as a long time barbie fan I'm pleased.

10.0,The Movie That Was Constructed Like a Nuclear Bomb,AntoniusLeontius,28 July 2023,"The film, Oppenheimer, is the ultimate perception of the nuclear bomb and its creators. From the pique of your curiosity before the film, to the hours during the film that you are bombarded with its endless dramatic chaos, to the hours after the movie that you spend contemplating its awesome and terrifying power, I have never seen such a film that totally and unequivocally humbles all your sensibilities. Nor have I seen a movie that surrounds you with so much about the power of death, and yet only shows one actual death in the entire film.The film, much like the mysterious wave-particle duality of Quantum Mechanics, is itself a duality. The fusion and fission of opposites defines the movie and its tortured lead protagonist. The plot itself is structured like the bomb. At the core of the film is the Los Alamos test explosion, and the film's events both prior to and after the scene are surrounded with all the dysfunction of the human being, most notably through the mind of Oppenheimer himself. The fallout of the test includes internal and external politics reminiscent of Julius Caesar, disordered relationships, neurotic breakdowns, endless civilian deaths. And yet in the midst of all that is also patriotism, ingenuity, victory, glory, and a willingness to put aside all kinds of differences to prepare for the possibility of the Nazis having the nuclear bomb. And while we do not physically witness a single casualty from a bomb explosion in the entire film, this chaotic chain reaction of performances are so effectively conveyed that we don't need to see people dying to understand how dreadfully terrifying it is for man to have the power that he does. The explosiveness of the film comes from the exceptional performances of the film's cast, which are so adept at conveying the horrors, the guilt, the tragedy, the joy, the victory, and the dichotomy that is the nuclear bomb.Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is aesthetically exceptional, reflecting Oppie's mannerisms, tone of voice, and silent charisma such that he may as well be in the 1950s black and white films of old. More than anything, Cillian exceptionally communicates Oppenheimer's dichotomies: his gentleness coupled with his power, his hubris and humility, his charm and his ugliness, his sense of moral right and his tortured conscience. Opposite of him, Robert Downey Jr. Puts aside his charismatic whimsical typecast and portrays a very serious, humorless, and silently vicious Lewis Strauss. And although I felt he was not nearly as convincing as Cillian, he damn well gave one of the best performances of his life. The two are supported by an all-star cast that are so effective at bringing Oppie's world to life.It should be known that Oppenheimer is, in many ways, a massive departure from previous Christoper Nolan films, including nude scenes which have gained some controversy. While many Nolan films always have a profound contemplative tone that is coupled with gunshots, constant explosions and doomsday clocks, Oppenheimer most definitely appeals to a different audience that is more ruminative and introverted. For this, the audience must be prepared to pay attention and think on Christopher Nolan's terms. But if you are willing to give the dog a bone, that dog will be both your best friend and greatest nemesis for as long as you can remember this movie.",Oppenheimer
4.0,Barbie in two words: Stereotypical. Cliche.,mfgkqwcx,25 July 2023,"Outstanding cast that tried to save a shortsighted and predictable storyline. Gosling once again shows that he's in a class of his own. Barbie started out fun but shortly into the film, the vibe changes and things take a turn for the worse. The room changes from lighthearted laughter, excitement, and anticipation to a tension one can sense easily. Our fun and bubbly Barbie soon begins to experience those all too cliche, hashed-out stereotypical mantras as she becomes an empowered woman. Sprinkled throughout are moments of goodness especially from Ryan Gosling and the soundtrack is killer as well. Seems like whoever made this movie had issues that they wanted us all to deal with instead of telling us a great story.",Barbie
9.0,Actually Supports Men and Women,FireJach,22 July 2023,"This movie is an intelligence test. I saw many comments how people're describing the movie attacks men. It actually doesn't. I am a man, maybe even a stereotypical one - I loved Sigma Ken part, it was hilarious. I have a degree in Economics and love to work out in the gym, watching action movies, dark jokes, drink not cheap beers...I believe the movie told a full of heart story how both sides (men and women) should team work more! The story perfectly told in a satirical way explains in what areas we all struggle. I won't go deep dive in because my short review doesn't contain any spoilers but trust me, the movie tries to be supportive and share a thoughtful and warm message in a fun way. It isn't woke, it doesn't treat the audience like a dumbass, it doesn't tokenise anybody, it doesn't force anything. It represents people lost in the world, trying to find their place and I think it says: Chill out.Don't be mad. Go there with open heart and mind and have fun because I did. Ryan Gosling was fantastic.",Barbie
8.0,"A film about a real person, not an action movie or a cinematic sci-fi",motasim-07204,23 July 2023,"Unlike Nolan's other films, this is to watch alone from home with a glass of whiskey.A $100,000,000 was enough to hire great actors and make the best possible dramatic experience, but evidently not enough to make the best possible cinematic experience.Considering that the Trinity test, Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings were the conclusion of Oppenheimer's work. Reducing such events to a dramatic close-up with a great soundtrack is just not good enough.Knowing how much money is wasted on pointless movies, being conservative with a story of this significance knocked 2 stars out from my review because I expected more visuals instead of a dramatic documentary in a crowded cinema. It could have been better!A true story, filled to the brim with legendary characters. A tale of omnipotent spending to destroy an enemy, re-enacted with a modest budget.",Oppenheimer

It's a fictional land, while the film is so raw. Margot Robbie is a joy to watch and showed an impressive performance. I believed she was Barbie.

Its intriguing plot kept me engaged throughout, and I genuinely believe that any attempt to shorten it would have undermined its impact. What struck me the most was its profound relevance to the current concerns surrounding artificial intelligence and ChatGPT. The movie left me awestruck, pondering the potential consequences of advancing technology. It paints a vivid picture of a future where humanity might be like two scorpions in a cage if we let conflicts escalate. Thought-provoking and riveting, this film leaves an indelible mark, urging us to reflect on the path our world is taking.",Oppenheimer

At first you get confused why you don't understand, what that happens and that and then the story keep slowly unfolding while also building tension with the viewer as well. Unfortunately, I didn't get to see the movie in imax cinema, because we don't have true Imax in Germany, but nonetheless, it was very enjoyable experience and was worth every minute. I would definitely recommend watching the movie if you haven't already.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Brilliant rebranding idea,fernandhaguedes,26 July 2023,"With a production by Mattel it self it's an amazing marketing idea to invite, the critical young thinkers of this generation, to the brand. With lots of self criticism, the movie give other vision about the atual demand of what the Barbie doll always should be.The movie jokes with the patriarch world we live and also shows a subtil criticism over it with the ""other side"". Almost like - Equilibrium should win this battle.Jokes about the masculinity and the critics themselves, showing a child who critic the old Barbie fans at the same time as she itself is a ""Barbie"" of the new era.At the same time brings us, the main public (early 90s under) all the nostalgic memories of playing dolls. That should be soft but people are always trying to be something else.Great deal.",Barbie
10.0,"Masterpiece, if you understand what you are in for",riveradisaac,24 July 2023,"Going into watching oppenheimer many people felt disappointed because of the court scenes. This is the story of OPPENHEIMER. Not the story behind the a bomb or the manhattan project. Yes that plays a huge part into the life and story of oppenheimer but so does everything that happened after which dramatically effected his life.Nolan takes this and makes it into the most interesting and most spectacle viewing experience i have had in a while in the theatre.The score ..... OMG this score is something other worldly, stands levels above that of inception and interstellar and that is a veryyyyy BIG STATEMENT TO MAKE. But there were times where i felt an atomic bomb to the chest. And having scenes where i was on my toes .Like i said its a masterpiece. Top 3 Nolan film .",Oppenheimer
10.0,Movie of the year,dombernetti,21 July 2023,This movie was a pure display of art. Every scene was extremely impactful and suspenseful. It was a long movie but you were intensely driven in the whole time. Cillian Murphy truly captured the character and showing the human side/ moral dilemmas of a man that believe that he gave the world the power to destroy itself was amazing. It showed showed a very real and what felt like very true side to a life alter event that happened in your history and you could feel every bit of that impact in the audience as these decisions were being made. The acting was great for all characters and the ability to give what felt like back stage passes to one of the biggest events in the past century was amazing. It puts very recent events and current events in perspective and gives the audience a lot to talk about and discuss. Well done.,Oppenheimer
10.0,Nolan did it again,AVAndrea-,21 July 2023,"I'm glad i saw another Nolan film in the theatre. The amazing soundtrack, beautiful cinematography, outstanding performances... it's a masterpiece that tells the story of a necessary evilonce again, Cillian reminds us that he's one of the goats. Matt Damon is exceptional; the fleeting appearances of Gary Oldman and Casey Affleck don't leave anyone indifferent, and RDJ... in those last twenty minutes he shows that this is the best acting he has ever done in his lifethe Trinity test is one of the best sequences i've ever seen in a movie. Nolan is truly one of the greatest filmmakers of the modern cinema.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Incredibly fun & easily profound,barragart,24 July 2023,"I went to see the movie with the feeling it was being hyped to much and with not so high expectations, -even though I admire Greta Gerwig a lot- but not even fifteen minutes into the movie I was already laughing and crying and hooked. It is definitely one of the funniest I've seen in at least 2 years, it has a simple storyline that works exactly as it suppose to without trying to be something else. The message is powerful and easy to understand, I found it refreshing and truthful, sometimes it may feel even a bit naive, but in the end it is what it is and I appreciated that. The performances are really delightful and full of small nuances that make them easy to connect with, even though the tone is satiric and farcical. Great movie, a lot more than I expected.",Barbie
4.0,Barbenheimer! Decent comedy handled with a sledgehammer,otaku-90710,21 July 2023,"Saw this kind of late on 07/21 after Oppenheimer. As expected the movie looks great, Barbieland is a crazy set, shot well and all actors are committed.Was a bit disappointed with Gosling but could just be the writing/direction for him. Margot Robbie and America Ferrara shine the most, and to a lesser extent Gosling, Kate McKinnon and Will Ferrell (those last two are smaller side characters).Some issues with pacing or maybe the movie should've shorter, and the music wasn't all that memorable surprisingly. I would've like more songs or better yet for this whole movie to be a musical!My biggest gripe is the writing. It is painfully heavy handed, preachy and full of cringe. This is because the evil patriarchy and righteous feminism is ramped up to 100.I honestly kept checking my watch, was looking at uber's home with like 30-40min left, and struggling so hard not to walk out (i never do, always stay to the end no matter what!) or fall asleep. Maybe it was partly because I had just gotten out of the 3hr Oppenheimer (which I had a strong coffee during) but this was one of the toughest movies I had to sit through in a theater in a very long time.I think most, but still probably not all, women will enjoy it, but for the fellas? Unless you're a self described male feminist or far-left politically, or maybe just a simp, your mileage is really going to vary and this may not be for you.I like Greta Gerwig and the cast but this was a big miss and let down for me. Messaging aside, I struggle to give this higher than a 5, maybe a 6 at the absolute best, wouldn't give it lower than a 3. So I'm going with 4/10.",Barbie
8.0,It's a Cristopher Nolan film,mrshawdy33,29 July 2023,"Let me start by saying that I enjoyed this movie.All in all, after 3 hours, I felt like my time had been spent well watching a well-crafted, visually and emotionally compelling biography about Robert Oppenheimer.It was good. If you like film, go see it in a theater (in IMAX if possible)However, it is a Christopher Nolan film.Meaning.... A lot of characters to keep track of, longer run time, lots and lots of dialogue, etc.This is not the kind of movie you would turn on in the background while dozing off scrolling on instagram.This movie, you have to stay attentive to the details, dialogue, and the story.BUT, because of this hyper-focused nature of the movie, you truly start to feel the story and emotions behind Oppenheimer, and begin to understand the complex nature of Nolan's story telling. I'd say it's worth the extra focus.Personally, I'd set this as slightly better than Tenet, but not to the lengths of Inception.Go see it :)",Oppenheimer
8.0,Oppenheimer - A Fast Paced History Movie (with an extreme long runtime),CutlasSaber,25 July 2023,"I've honestly never been a huge fan of Christopher Nolan, and I will admit that I haven't seen a lot of his more popular movies (with the exception of The Dark Knight trilogy). From what I know about Nolan's work is how unique the editing is in his films, and you can kinda tell from the odd editing choices, specifically when Oppenheimer would hallucinate. While I do see how that kind of style can better develop Oppenheimer's character by visually showing us how he is feeling, I can see how this can be bothersome to some people. Personally, I really enjoyed it.I will say that this movie is really fast paced despite its three hour run time, and with that being said, it can be hard to follow at times. I'll admit that there were some scenes that just shove information down the audiences throat, and as someone who has ADHD it took me a while to catch up to what was happening in the story, and it doesn't help that Nolan likes to skip through time numerous times throughout the film (but then again, it did help that they had a balanced mixture of black and white scenes and colored scenes.While I do think this film is fast paced, I think the story did take that pace away from me with how the story was told. To clarify, there seemed to have been a climatic ending halfway into the film, but instead of ending, more consistencies rise and thus, more conflict needs to be resolved. Usually I hate when movies do this, but I oddly enjoyed the final act a lot more than the ""climax"" in the middle of the film.What people need to understand about this film is that it isn't about the bomb, well, it is, but most of the movie focuses on Oppenheimer's life leading up to him making the bomb, and the aftermath of what his creation has done after America bombed Japan. I thought they really told a great story here, and Oppenheimer, as well as many other characters in this film were written very well.Most of the film consists on talking, so if you're ere expecting a full-blown war movie, don't have that in your mind at all when you walk into this film. I recommend this to any history movie-goers, as it's pretty informative about Oppenheimer's life leading up to the creation of the bomb that practically ended World War II.",Oppenheimer
1.0,Profundity Sold Seperately,craigfish-86029,19 July 2023,"It's a Barbie movie. It is as saccharine as Treacle and as empty as Barbie's head. A pink spectacle, and much like the doll, you can try to attach some accessories or throw on a doctor's coat or any array of add-ons you want. However, at the end of the day, it's a cheap children's toy, that any sane adult should ignore or only look upon as some bitter-sweet memento of a childhood that they will never regain.Throughout the build-up to the release of this film, I was led to believe that behind the gloss there was a deeper meaning to it. Greta Gerwig is regarded as an auteur, and the script was said to be too good to pass up. In the end, the message was too shallow to be impactful, the story too 'meta' to be taken seriously, and the dialogue as stiff as the plastic that Barbie is cast from for it to be any good. At least we know who the Real Barbie is for, but when I left the theatre I had no idea who the film is for or what it was really trying to say. It's not exactly a kids' film. It's not an intelligent art house film. It's not a summer action-packed blockbuster, it's not an interesting take on modern-day feminism, nor does it provide any sort of interesting commentary on any social or political issue. It is just a boring pink distraction.",Barbie
7.0,She's Everything. He's Just Ken.,UnderTheScene,23 July 2023,"Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" is a stunning piece of cinema when it comes to costume and set design which blew me away with. Also had good songs and catchy musical numbers but was not as good as expected. With a film being called ""Barbie"" Margot Robbie was great as usual, but Ryan Gosling's Ken was the one who absolutely stole the show with it being his funniest role to date. Now the first 10-15 minutes were rough to get through for myself with the introduction to Barbie world, which is understandable considering what it is. But then even leading into the ""Real-World"" part of the film some of it still had the cheesy bits that I didn't like. From that point on though I did end up enjoying most of the film and the performances from everyone on screen. Overall, the good moments outweigh the bad ones and it ending up being a good fun/comedy film.",Barbie
7.0,I finally understood Nolan films,kuarinofu,29 July 2023,"I had anticipated a more straightforward, character-driven study of the man who helped to develop the atomic bomb, but instead, I was met with a 3-hour long summer blockbuster and a possibility of hearing loss.Thinking about this, I feel guilty for not understanding Nolan's summer films since I've seen all of them except Memento. Now it is clearer that this (Oppenheimer) is exactly what I should've expected, but for some reason, I didn't.So now, understanding that I went to see it with a wrong impression or a misunderstanding of the director's style, I'll give my two cents on this one.The film's editing was particularly problematic. The director is known for his use of quick cuts and jarring transitions, but in Oppenheimer, this style felt overused and gratuitous. The film's many plot threads were constantly being cut away from, making it difficult to follow the narrative up until the very end. Not much complaining can be done after Tenet and Dunkirk, but again, I expected something different for a bio-drama.The sound mixing was also poor, with the dialogue often being drowned out by the music. This was especially frustrating during the film's tensest moments when I was desperate to hear what the characters were saying. Again, this was my IMAX experience. Maybe yours will be different.Another problem is that there's just too much story. Oppenheimer wasn't a short film by no means, the creators wanted to make a deep dive into the political and historical background of some of the major characters, and there were so many of them. I don't think making this a solo film was a good idea, but a Chornobyl-style mini-series - would've worked great. They had so many good actors, but they were forced to fly through the scenes on an airplane bomber since they were limited by the runtime.Despite these flaws, there were many redeeming qualities to Oppenheimer. The film's performances were all excellent, much so I cannot single out a particular one. The film's visuals were also stunning, with Nolan's trademark use of IMAX cinematography creating some truly awe-inspiring images. The soundtrack was plain gorgeous, and very memorable. Too bad that it was mixed into scenes where it shouldn't have been, and it also had some weird cuts, almost like clipping, ruining the tone. Like it was artificially cloned and stretched. Maybe I'm making this up.Ultimately, Oppenheimer is a film that is both ambitious and flawed. It is a film that attempts to grapple with the weighty subject matter of the atomic bomb, but it ultimately fails to do so satisfyingly for me. I would recommend watching the film at home, where you can adjust the volume and take breaks as needed.P. S. I also want to thank the creators for finally giving me an understanding of what to expect, and saving me from later disappointments.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Let's go Barbie! And Ken is a Ten,mohnomachado,25 July 2023,"I may not have played with Barbie dolls and fairly no interest in this from a subject standpoint, but I have to say this movie rocks. Margot Robbie is awesome, Gerwig's direction is solid, the writing is well thought out, the colors pop, and let's not forget how amazing Ryan Gosling is in this. His Ken will go down in history as one of his best roles, calling it now. I do wish there were things that were more utilized in the film, especially Venice Beach as a location. It felt really shoe horned into the plot. Also some of the side characters just really didn't need to be there. But overall, this picture really works because it's messaging about the hardships of the modern woman is spot on. Also I liked how they actually critiqued Mattel at times for making a doll with insane beauty standards for young children. I'm definitely looking forward to see where Gerwig takes her career after this because this is truly a box office and critical smash that can lead to some interesting projects in the future.",Barbie
3.0,"Wonderfull setup, with a not so wonderfully excecuted message",nenasarec,22 July 2023,"The production and the costume design is absolutely wonderful, same goes to the most of the cast. With beautiful attention to detial, uncluding actual cars and houses that we played with.But the message of ""patriarchy is bad"" seemed to be shoved down your throat too aggressively, with the whole thing seeming a bit misguided and hateful toward men, and i dont believe in battling hate with hate. Dont understand me wrong i am a woman in engineering (world dominated by men), but the concept of feminism is not men vs women and what most feminists strive for is not matriarchal, which the barbie word is. Pinning us against each other is not helpful, as we should work together to reach equality, one cannot work without the other. What could be a wonderful message turned confusing and too strong in my taste.",Barbie
8.0,"I'm a Barbie girl, in a Barbie world...",agnieszkacieslakmatfiz,19 July 2023,"While not seeing previous Greta Gerwig's movies might have been a mistake on my side, starting exploring her filmography with Barbie (2023) was surely quite an interesting choice. Honestly, I was a little scared and worried about finally seeing this film - after so much hype on Twitter and other social media it would be disappointing finding out that the movie is not a 10/10 masterpiece. Eventually, I decided that no matter how bad (or good) Barbie actually is, at least I will have the pleasure of seeing Ryan Gosling's astonishing face (and body) on the big screen. The first few scenes of the film absolutely captivated me with their doll-like, plastic pink aesthetic, showing Barbieland as a perfect, colorful paradise. I have to admit though, once our two main characters travelled to the real world, things got a little cheesy. Of course I didn't expect Barbie to be deep or dramatic, but for me it fell into the family toys-come-to-life movie cliche a little bit too much. However, I really liked the comedious aspect of the film, all the references to history of the Barbie doll and others. I might as well say that Barbie became my new comfort movie, something to watch with your best buds, or even a loved one.",Barbie
3.0,Overrated barbie,ametin-86250,24 July 2023,"It's like a women's solidarity movie. It was a production in which all men were shown as 2nd class and this was done through a good cast and a well-established company. It's a totally overrated PR movie. Despite all this, the acting was successful. However, the movie did not meet my expectations. Ryan gosling and margot ronbbie are both good actors, but this scenario limited both of their abilities. In my opinion, product placement and advertisements were also over exaggerated. It was like the longest commercial I've ever seen in my life. I can say that I counted the minutes, especially for the last half hour of the movie to end, it was not a movie worth all this expectation.",Barbie
6.0,It's alright,captainsermig,21 July 2023,"""If you brought a 7 year old girl to see this movie she would neither have fun nor be happy at all"" And this was my girlfriend's statement as soon as we left the cinema.I see it as an ok movie, occasionally very entertaining but overall chaotic, a bit cliché and even boring at times.Solid 6/10, i've seen worse but pales in comparison to The Lego Movie and other ""nostalgic intellectual property movies"" such as Mario Bros, which can contain deep messages without ruining the whole thing as I feel Barbie did.I have to give credit to the numerous exhilarating scenes with the Kens and the CEO, stereotyping done right IMHO.",Barbie
10.0,If it went on for another 3 hours I'd of gladly watched,anotherdankavanagh,25 July 2023,"Go see it in Imax and the slight increased ticket price is worthy of your money, it's a visual and audible feast, good value entertainment is hard to come by these days and this delivers. I'd dissuade anyone from going just for the explosion this is a biopic based around a key point in Oppenheimer's life, not just building a bomb. After reading some reviews I thought it'd be challenging to keep up with a few timelines but it was a breeze, the pace although on the fast side makes for compelling storytelling. The score and sound are perfect and exactly what you'd expect from Imax, the well placed/timed loudness adds to the experience and makes this a well constructed immersive look into the life of a controversial historical figure. Just on my way to binge all Nolan's movies now.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Maybe Nolans best work,axelbergsand,30 July 2023,"Oppenheimer is based on a real story but that story is so well produced in the movie that it almost feel like a sci-fi. One characteristic that Nolan movies usually have is that they are high paced and really pulls you right in. His movies are usually very long but they don't feel like they are when they are exciting the entire time, and how he managed to pull it off in a 3 hour long real story is really why this should be considered a masterpiece.I have now watched almost every Nolan movie from Memento to Oppenheimer and I can without doubt say that its one of his best. Of course he's a great SCI-FI director but this is different just like Dunkirk was before and it makes you wonder what genre he'll do next because his storytelling is on another level.A Director is nothing without his crew and I want to point out how well the casting of this movie is. You could argue that he's lucky to have this many great actors working for him but to pick an actor like Robert Downey Jr for this role really shows you how well Nolan and his casting director knows about actors considering that he has mostly played heroes in movies. Cillian Murphy is probably doing one of the greatest acts in movie history and he should win the Oscar no doubt. It wouldn't surprise me if Robert Downey Jr gets one too for best supporting act but his screen time might be just slightly too limited.",Oppenheimer

4.0,Extremely OVER HYPED,celebsentourage,23 July 2023,"Definitely not understanding why this movie was over hyped. What age demographic is this movie for exactly? It's not a movie for little kids. Maybe pre teen girls? And I can't understand how they wouldn't be bored with this film. It's music every couple of mins and everything is way over the top. Actors were great but the script isn't entertaining at all. Honestly the trailer was more fun than the movie. My kids were bored and wanted to leave before the end. But after we made it through the first half of the movie, we might as well suck it up until the end. All in all, an amazing cast and set, but it falls short in actually entertaining the audience.",Barbie
10.0,Cinematic masterpiece,jjqqhnqhg,19 July 2023,"Nolan is back and delivers a fast paced thrilling biopic that will leave you stunned.the cinematography, sound design, score all exceptional. Every acting performance is perfect with Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey JR standing out. Nolan is experimenting with new styles of surrealist and subjective filmmaking to him which is so incredible to see from such a seasoned writer and director. He's pushing the envelope with Oppenheimer and challenging the audience like never before.Nolan's character study merges a thematically resonant story with a breathtaking soundscape & epic visuals.

10.0,It's special.,pranam-bhavani,27 July 2023,"I left the theatre in awe of this film. The story is so compelling and expressed the duality of creating a weapon that can save and destroy masterfully. The performances are sublime, Cillian Murphy will rightfully collect plaudits from everyone for a stunning performance as the titular character but RDJ and notably Emily Blunt deliver some breathtaking performances that I am amazed by.Christopher Nolan shows every bit of his genius when it comes to film making, the cinematography is flawless and he picks his moments with sound and visual effects perfectly. They all serve a purpose contributing to the storytelling and the epic cinematic moments in this film.This film is undoubtedly and unequivocally a must see and a contender for Nolan's best work.",Oppenheimer

9.0,Very fun movie!,christinalishal,22 July 2023,"This movie was everything that was expected of it. It was funny, feministic, cute, beautiful and everything plastic. It was probably expected by many that the movie would be very superficial and focus more on the fun side of barbie, but it surprised us. This movie took a deep dive into what it is to be a girl and a woman in today's society and in the patriarchal world we live in today. It also brought into daylight the problematic history surrounding the plastic doll with many humorous elements. The only thing that brought this film down from a 10/10 was that it was everything we expected, and was missing a surprising plot twist. All in all I really recommend to watch this movie, it was a wonderful experience in the cinema!",Barbie
5.0,Half-baked script with an impressive budget,cincinnatihannah,23 July 2023,"This movie LOOKED amazing. The costumes, sets, editing, and choreography were all high-budget and high-quality. That's probably why the poor writing stuck out like a sore thumb.The characters are one-dimensional, the plot was not developed, the themes are poorly executed, and the ending had almost no connection to the rest of the movie. Other people have mentioned the movie's preachiness; instead of developing the message over the course of the movie, the mother character gives multiple speeches to let the audience know exactly what we're supposed to think. What happened to ""show, don't tell""?Robbie and Gosling did what they could with the script that they had, making the movie enjoyable enough. The rest of the ensemble had no standouts, and the other Barbies were frustratingly identical in their one-dimensional performances.Speaking of Gosling, did anyone else feel like Ken had more character depth than Barbie? In the BARBIE movie? Don't get me wrong, I loved his performance, but it definitely felt like he upstaged Robbie's Barbie for a large part of the movie.Overall, it was enjoyable, but I wouldn't waste money on a theater ticket. Watch it when it comes out on streaming and form your own opinion.",Barbie
9.0,Masterpiece,atton-felipe,21 July 2023,"Nolan is back again in the game. Always using great shots, good actors, nagnificent performances and scenarios, making it ideal. The trama is good, it keeps you in the edge of your seat, nail bitting conversations, and helping with the memory on flashbacks to the characters with a lot of lastnames and not too many background for each (except Einstein), to improve the experience of the mlvie. Even with 3 hours long, it never felt like more than a 2 hour film, because it was so intense and you are so deep in the trama, that you dont see the time flow. Romantic scenes are short and precise, so it is a great overal movie to watch. Band reminds you to interstellar and Batman, so it is a great gesture. Psycho is intense with mind blowing scenes that leave you thinking on what could happen.Nolan, you are GREAT once more.",Oppenheimer

8.0,Very Well Done,douglaseparry-67537,24 July 2023,"This was a tough one because I would consider myself a film nerd. I have been for 20+ years. So, was this film a high level of filmmaking? Yes. Was the acting in this film top notch. Yes! Was the writing, costume, set design, editing all good? Yes. I don't mind movies that are dialogue heavy. This was definitely that type. I had trouble giving this an 8, but I figured it did mostly everything great...however, just didn't captivate me like I was expecting. If I'm being honest, it felt like a 7.6 or so. Which I consider really good.The story kind of dragged on a little longer than I felt it needed. It wasn't particularly entertaining (Even though I like historical pieces and this subject matter) I just didn't get into it as much as I thought. It's like it's missing something and I haven't put my finger on it. Kind of reminds me of how I felt after the J. Edgar Hoover film.Anyways, it's worth a watch.",Oppenheimer
5.0,A disappointment,ricsokovi,22 July 2023,"I simply can't like this movie. It wants to say way too much and says way too little about way too many things. It can't decide what it wants to be, so it's not really anything - not just for the viewer, but for the creator. And that's a problem. It's not good as a biopic: there are serious historical flaws in the story, which irritated me. I'm a huge fan of John von Neumann... anyone, who knows who he was understands why I mention him. As a drama? The movie can't decide the centre of the drama. It's too weak as a spy-story, too weak as a political drama, too weak as a personal drama. Not one aspect is worked out to carry the film. The strongest aspect was how many times in american history the ""what you did 20 years ago is more important than who you become and what your expertese is"" ruined people's lives. Or at least was used as a political rethoric against opponents. And I appreciated that, hence the 5 points. As a moral/personal evolution the moral conflict isn't built up, the ""evolution of a scientist"" dies away halfway and doesn't really connect with the ""organizer scientist"". The ""science should or should not have moral boundaries"" isn't worked out and built up, just comes and goes without a purpose. The only detactable personal evolution is the ""man of future becomes the man of past"", but somehow that remains too weak in the end, too. So the movie falls apart and not even the brilliant actors and the massively impressive explosion scene can hold it together.I couldn't help feeling how Nolan this time couldn't feel the fine line of balance... that ""sometimes less is more"".",Oppenheimer
7.0,N,jasonvagner,23 July 2023,"Positives: Cillian Murphy is amazing, Robert Downey Jr really shows up, The B&W photography is beautifulWeaknesses: The analog Nolanisms are a distraction (Fincher contended with period-isms better in Manhunter using digital processes and CGI), Audio mix is muddled and hard on the dialogue, 70MM film stock is over-sold for a movie that largely takes plan indoors, the non-linear timeline gets a bit confusingBiggest problem: Nolan's work in this film is extremely derivative, 1st 1/3rd directly quotes T Malick and A Beautiful Mind, Last 1/3rd (the interrogations) is very Lumet, The internal conflict noisey white-out bits is very Villeneuve (but, done badly), The first kissing scene in the desert is poorly and distractingly blockedGreat story, amazing performances, but a strike against Nolan as an auteur. All the previously referenced directors, even the ones working recently, developed a coherently new thing for audiences. Nolan really fails that attempt in this movie. While sitting in the movie theater, I pretty quickly wished someone else had made this movieWorth seeing for the acting and the story, not as an accomplishment in film-making or directing.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Another Nolan Masterclass of a Film!,mattshipp-66815,21 July 2023,"First off, please please go see and support this film!Oppenheimer tells the real life story of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the many intricacies of his life throughout university and then leading to his work on the Manhattan Project. I will tell you right off I left the theater in awe and, looking back on it now, a little disconcerted with the last few scenes of the film. (Once you see, you'll understand) Christopher Nolan has once again simply outdone himself with this film, he is my favorite filmmaker working today and seems to be one of the only filmmakers to be given the budget to make massive films like Oppenheimer, Interstellar, Inception, Tenet, Dunkirk, and so many more to support going to the movies.The film is, yes, three hours long and very dialogue heavy but this three hour film went by with the snap of a finger. Nolan does a brilliant job of accelerating the pace of the film and it sort of traps you and locks you in place. Throughout watching the film thirty minutes of it was just gone, like it had evaporated. Nolan does a brilliant job editing his films to where there is little to no fat left around the edges and no extra baggage, every scene has its place.You will definitely, and I for one, will have to watch this film more than once as there is just so much too unpack with this film. The star power in this film alone is tremendous, the score is mesmerizing, the visual effects fantastic, the performances are enthralling, and Chris Nolan is at the top of his game!This film should and will get a lot of love and praise come awards season. Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Shine in this film and their performances are one of, if not the, best of their respective careers. Christopher Nolan deserves at least nominations for Best Director, Best Adapted or Original Screenplay, and Best Picture at the Oscars, and he should definitely win his first Oscar this awards season. While Cillian Murphy deserves at least a nomination for Best Actor and Robert Downey Jr. Deserves a nomination for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars as well. Both of them could win both with these performances easily.A truly tremendous film and one that requires multiple viewings to be truly appreciated!",Oppenheimer
10.0,"Nolan masterpiece, this is cinema",myhkhcq,23 July 2023,"One of the best movies that I have ever seen. Just amazing. Three hours of authentic Cinema.A great movie that keeps you glued to your seat from the beginning, telling us the story of a young physicist who will become transcendental in the history of the modern world. A 10 out of 10.Technically superlative, an outstanding photography and surround sound that immerses you completely in the story.Brilliant performance by Cillian Murphy, and also remarkable awesome cast.

8.0,Barbie Is A Weirdly Fun Movie!,HabibieHakim123,19 July 2023,"8.5/10 While i'm not so sure at first, the movie kept getting even more fun, entertaining, and definitely better, also surprisingly deal with a legit serious stuff, Barbie is a weirdly fun movie that fills with this very interesting concept, definitely the first time that's ever done, Greta Gerwig has created this whole new style of filmmaking specifically for Barbie, from the intentionally weird yet creative editing, some awkward and cringe scene, i found the comedy so funny instead of cringe, Barbie is one of the most original movie of the year and also one of the most original movie i've seen in a while, we all know Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is gonna carry the movie and they are, but Will Ferrell, Simu Liu, and the whole rest of the cast were also great and entertaining, the soundtrack was just great, except Nicki Minaj and Ice Spice ""Barbie World"" song that are just absolutely terrible, but Billie Eilish ""What Was I Made For?"" tune that kept haunting in the background until it finally get the perfect scene to played it was really the best thing because that song was just beautiful and emotional, anyway, Barbie is a lot of fun, while there is still some noticeable flawed, most of them i found it funny, entertaining, colourful, creative, and fun, pure fun, it's something that i probably will love it even more the second time i see it, but as of right now, Barbie was a good time, definitely recommended and with this movie somehow it's actually possible to have a live-action Barbie movie, all you need to have is a good writer, good director, and good cast, and they delivers mostly.",Barbie
10.0,We are all Barbie,KristinaGeorgievaBG,26 July 2023,"Barbie it's not just a movie about some dolls and perfection. This movie says a lot about everything. In the first seconds of it I thought there wouldn't be something meaningful. I thought it would be some fun movie just to chill while you're watching it. But this movie is a lot more than just fun. With this movie we can see ourselves in it. It shows how powerful women are. But also how hard it is to be a woman. And not just that. Also our childhood. The barbieland is our childhood. Peaceful, enjoying life. But when it's our time to leave it, it's scary and new because that's the adult life. The finale scene shows us that to live is the most beautiful thing we can experience. And some people are stereotypical barbies who don't know how to live their life in the most human way. We are here to smile, cry and improve ourselves. But sometimes we get lost and need to find ourselves again. It's a cycle that we need to go through. This movie represents a lot of things not just one. And I think everyone who watches that film can find a different meaning.",Barbie
8.0,Dumb Fun,bmlchick,23 July 2023,"First, lower your expectations and second, this is not a children's movie. Lastly, don't take it seriously.Go in with those three things in mind and if you have any sense of humor, you will really enjoy this film.It's honestly really dumb fun, along the lines of Anchorman or Talladega Nights. No, it's probably not as good as either of those, but is along the same comedic line and it is really funny and charming.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are both hysterical and do a great job in the movie. The entire theater laughed out loud through most of the movie. The supporting cast was spot on as well.There was a ton of reminiscing happening in the theater. You could hear countless women whispering ""I had that play set!"" Or ""I had that Barbie outfit."" That made the movie more enjoyable for many.Overall the movie was really good. In my opinion, the only misses were, every man in the movie was over the top stupid. No reason for that. And I believed the ending should have gone in a different direction, but I won't spoil it with my opinion.",Barbie
10.0,Nolan's Opus,MNjets2021,21 July 2023,"This is the film that cements Christopher Nolan as one of the best contemporary directors working as well as one of the best to ever make movies. From the moment the film starts, it hits the ground running and never lets up. It knows exactly what pace it wishes to set for three hours. There are even moments where you may not be 100% percent sure what is happening, but rest assured it all comes together. See it on the biggest screen you can find. I cannot wait to see this again because I'm sure there are parts that I didn't fully grasp. I might say this is one of the greatest films of all time easily one of the best of the past ten years or so. Go see it - now......",Oppenheimer

With its captivating storytelling, brilliant direction, and impeccable performances, this movie takes us on an immersive journey into the life and mind of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb. The film skillfully delves into the complexities of his character, exploring his genius, conflicts, and moral dilemmas. The attention to historical accuracy and the meticulous recreation of the era adds authenticity to the overall experience.

4.0,Good luck following the plot,bthomas-91806,22 July 2023,"The first two hours are fine. By the final hour, the time period had jumped so many times that I lost the plot. As a result, after three hours, we still don't have a sense of who Oppenheimer was.The characters were not developed fully, and I'm wondering why the Robert Downey character was in the film at all. He added nothing to the story.The story was over after the trinity test, but it kept going...and going. And then without telling us why, suddenly powerful DC people are trying to ruin Oppenheimer.The film isn't bad, it just doesn't tell a story that is easily followed. But that's kind of a Nolan trademark.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Wildly misunderstood by the poor reviewers.,anniebleasdale-97708,23 July 2023,"Unfortunately, most reviews that I've read here that score this film poorly explain so clearly that the reviewer did not understand the message of the film. It is not anti-men, it does not portray men as ""stupid"". Take a moment to think about how women have been portrayed in movies over the last century - oh yes, just as Ken is here! The movie exaggerates this, yes. That is the point. To clearly (and humourously) highlight the inequalities when the roles are reversed. Stop being offended by something that isn't offensive and take a bit of time to actually think about the film that you have watched.The film was fun, emotional, moving, sad and empowering in many ways. I must admit I hadn't expected to enjoy this film, but wow, what a surprise!",Barbie
5.0,Beautiful sets and constumes. Short attention span.,input error,23 July 2023,"After the sugar rush of the first impressions has subsided, I am left mostly with a memory of excessive preaching. A couple of touching moments make me not regret seeing it, but it is not going to be on my recommendations lists.Lots of fun gags, but they were all over the place and it left main story and main characters arcs bare without enough details to flesh them out.So a couple of monologues that were supposed to be a powerful highlight of the movie, ended up landing a bit flat.Tokenism seemed superficial, and as such once again more of a distraction from the main story.Beautiful moments of Barbie learning to cry that reminded me of the understated magic Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach were able to create in their other works, but it was clearly not the style that matched well with the short attention span of this move.",Barbie
9.0,"A Long Slog Through History, But Blows Up The Quality Of the Genre",rgkarim,21 July 2023,"LIKES:The Presentation: -Oppenheimer had a lot happen in his life, and this movie does its best to capture it without being too historical -Nolan takes the underlying a story, a case, and uses it as a guiding line that helps tie together to the big parts and summarize his life. It works, and presents the evidence in this visual style and storytelling that works.-There is some Hollywood mixing that might stretch the truth, but it's balanced enough that I can't say it was annoying in conveying the struggles of this time period.-The result is a historical biography that moves, very important for a three hour period, and found myself engaged to listen to the tales of the father of quantum physics in America.The Acting: -No surprise, this is going to be a contender for best acting, and rightfully so given the performances presented in this movie.-Every single person, big or small, has this atmosphere that works. It blends Hollywood dramatic theater with biography and conveys relationships, tensions, and dynamics that are closer to the pulse of reality than some other dynamics.-The tension of the case is conveyed in everyone, and I loved this buildup of so many sides on this issue and it worked well.-Damon is great, his range of acting continues to impress me and the way he has such control over character nuances. This pushed him to several different levels and found his engagement and evolution, quite awesome.-Blunt started out okay for me, one of my top actresses feeling a little sidelined and conveying an okay character. The later acts show her style though and I loved watching this woman deliver these lines and emotions with such a top notch level of acting that spices up acts 3 and 4.-Murphy is the one to keep eyes on though. The man's complexity has evolved way past Red Eye, his conveyance of mannerisms, quirks, obsessions, and genius creepy and yet entrapping. He plays well with everyone, hits these roles of a changing career on high cylinders, and makes a historical character intriguing to look more into.-All in all, this is probably one of the stronger qualities of the film, but there is more to dive into.The Visuals/Cinematography: -Nolan is all about telling stories on a lot of levels, and visual sensations are a key component.-Oppenheimer has fantastic camera work, using angles, lighting, technology, and planning to find the optimum angle to give you the best of the situation.-The changing of filters for various parts adds this nuance that gives subtle changes, adding emotion and messages the likes I did not expect, while keeping me awake.-And the fact that it actively adapts to the character with hyper focus and realism, while still adding touches of grainy visuals of the times, is homage paid well.The Sound: -Thank the Lord, this movie got the sound right and proved editing can still be done.-Nolan's team gives crisp dialog, easy to understand and listen, without getting drowned out by other sounds.-It's the Imax worthy piece of it, the musical scores adding that emotion going to do well on top notch speakers, while the resounding booms and other effects get an added life.-Another level of immersion, the movie really used the budget well to make sure you get all the information you need to follow, and perhaps cast your own vote before the end.The Story Pieces Chosen: -For the most part, Oppenheimer's legacy is tied to the infamous device he crafted, but does that make the most interesting character for all?-Nolan seems to agree it doesn't, and like a good autobiography, finds snippets of his life to ingrain and add a bit more of the ""good stuff"" to enhance the character.-Facets of his life come into play at times, adding extra tests and impasses for him to work around while coordinating so much.-Friendships, relationships, and philosophies conveyed to some extent (though accurately I have no idea) that gives you more than just the science laden man you might think.-It works well for me and should help broaden the audience who will see that movie.-And to have details in all these components, both invention and non-invention, are finding a balance that is surprisingly well, though not as perfect as some might say.The Message: -Outside of Batman, Nolan's work is often very much ingrained in symbolism, morals, and some assessments of characters that works.-And Oppenheimer is loaded with that. A fantastic movie that tests the fortitude of the human emotion and make us question how much we should push the boundaries.-While a tad heavy at times with some lines, the movie is beautifully done to really show the horrors of progress and the good and bads that we must sometimes weigh.-It adds extra edge to the movie, and again gives you that amazing investment for your time, which again works super well with everything.DISLIKES:More Character Balance: -The movie has A LOT of names tied to it, and I won't lie that they aren't all in the movie to the same degree, so don't be surprised if your favorite is on and off in less than 30 minutes.-I mentioned Blunt before, but that evens out, but others, you have to be ready to hold tight to the moments they are in, and dive into books more with their engagement.-I would have liked more balance, integration, conveyance, and a few more moments that I wanted to see were absent. Inclusion would have bloated this film more, but a part of me would have loved more time with several characters.The Presentation Is Odd At First: -Walking into the movie I asked if I had missed something.-The opening is very interesting and you have to be ready for that growth pain of the unique presentation, as you quickly go through his early life during this opening case.-About 20 minutes in, the movie evens out and I was able to understand the presentation style and where we were at. So if you can wade through the confusion at the start, you'll be fine.The Run Time: -It's 3 hours and at times it feels like it when you hit the transition moments that are odd, which slow down the pace.-While most of the stuff is then fine, the last twenty to thirty minutes are the slow parts of the movie and felt the longest. It's important, but... it just feels bloated, long, and very drawn out, that I was ready to go.-True it was hour 5 of a movie, but there were other facets more detail would be welcomed for me, like projects and bombs, instead of seeing this complex endgame. But... it's symbolic and fitting to the story so that helps blunt the time dilation the final effects have.The Audience Entertainment?-Perhaps the last thing to bring to the audience is that this movie requires you to pay attention.-For those looking for entertainment and getting away, without the realism and politics of the world, this movie can be tough to engage with.-The flashbacks and paying attention, keeping track of the names, it's a lot and this might just get in the way of the enjoyment aspect for some, especially when paired with the run time.-Thus, the movie is good and truly an artistic wonder that sticks out from others, but a general audience may be bored and dock scores if they don't know what they are getting.The VERDICT: Oppenheimer may be one of the most artistic and impressive movies of the year if not in a long time. Nolan proves once again that there is a medium of art and entertainment, and I was very engaged for much of this historical drama thanks to his directorial guidance. Fantastic acting with a stunning visual and audio collection bring history to life, and getting us engaged in a turning point of human culture. It's a summary of a tremendous man's life, and though it has some areas I want more of, did a nice job covering bases, with a little Hollywood spectacle added. True, it's a marathon and it isn't easy to hit if you are coming off a long day, one of the worst parts about it, but the pace and content are engaging to keep track of if you are looking for a deeper biographical film. Some character balance and pacing could be a tad smoothed out and cut down sure (maybe a director's cut), and it might not be the entertaining escape, but the movie really is worth the merit and praise for me given what it achieves in this genre. Teaching those lessons, with an engaging cast of characters, at a pace and timing that feels mostly complete without too much bloated feeling. Thus, my scores are:Biography/Drama/History: 9.5 Movie Overall: 9.0, maybe an 8.5 at the least.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Boom.,filmowl12,30 July 2023,"My goodness, what a disturbing film. I found the first hour to be very slow and a bit hard to follow. I definitely want to give it a second look (as hard as it is to look at), so I can obtain a clearer understanding. I am so grateful that I didn't watch this with my elderly parents as there is some nudity and a couple of unexpected sex scenes within the first half. But I must admit, seeing Florence Pugh naked did not suck.I was quite surprised by the performance of Robert Downey Jr. He plays a wicked dude and plays him very, very well. So convincing. Bravo performance, perhaps his best??Cillian Murphy, my dog. He was stunning. How he could transform into Oppenheimer and capture his conscience and internal struggle the way he did. Just wow, I felt all of that. It was heavy on the soul. When the film ended I literally gasped.We completed Barbenheimer today. We started with Oppenheimer and then it was on to Barbie. I recommend that order if you decide to go through with it. In Opp you contemplate the terrifying darkness we humans are capable of. It is true horror and an all to real and unsettling look into our nature. Barbie is a fun little movie with some surprising depth. There were some profound moments where Barbie marvels at the beauty that is present within humanity. Kind of healing and balances things out nicely. What an interesting time in cinema!",Oppenheimer
9.0,Smart enough of president Barbie,zacharytaylorwright,24 July 2023,"I definitely went in with doubts, as one does with the mass market films of day; but this was overwhelmingly more than good. It was the first actually great big box film I've seen in some time.I should've known. Greta Gerwig, with her smart indie-film whit, created something for everyone. Easy jokes. Clever jokes not everyone will latch onto. Even physical humor to get the kids cackling.All with a great message about finding the value in one's uniqueness at its core. Loved the self-poking Mattel allowed with that tax jokes.I will forever be saying ""Get in the box Jezebel."" Heck, it may even replace ""Get in losers.

Margot Robbie was a fantastic choice as Barbie. She shines, she makes you fall in LOVE with Barbie again, effervescent in every moment, she fully enveloped how a lot of us remember playing with Barbie, and what we thought and hoped for when we grew up.America Ferrera - fantastic. She brought me to tears Ryan Gosling was a scene stealer!

6.0,Falls short of greatness,mpavaonunes,22 July 2023,"Barbie turned out to be a bit of a letdown. I had high hopes for the movie, but it didn't quite meet my expectations. The story felt forced, and the narrative lacked a decisive direction. There were moments of humor, but it missed the opportunity to be hilariously entertaining. The film could have been much better if they had taken advantage of the potential for creative and imaginative storytelling that the Barbie franchise offers. Despite the visually appealing scenes, the overall execution left me feeling unsatisfied. I hoped for a more captivating and memorable experience, but unfortunately, it fell short of delivering that. It is good entertainment.",Barbie
10.0,"Great Nolan movie, not for everyone!",khoshkamroham,22 July 2023,"It's a great Christopher Nolan movie and definitely one of if not my favorite movie. However it's not a movie made for everyone. You need to have a good attention span and you have to be interested in it. Even I have to still comprehend it and overthink about it. I saw alot of people who say it is a boring movie and I think the reason is they didn't understand many parts. I think another reason is many people never watched a biography movie and only expect movies where there is a happy ending. Overall if you think you can watch a 3 hour masterpiece that is literally a biography, then watch it.",Oppenheimer

10.0,It's not what you think.,willsfamily11,29 July 2023,"I am a MASSIVE and lifelong Barbie fanatic. I went in to this movie absolutely pumped. I came out of the movie blown away. Typical of Barbie, she blew me away with the absolute depth of her message. America Ferrera's monologue in Barbie Land had people clapping in the theatre. I appreciated it as a Mother, daughter, sister, wife and human being. The truth bombs she dropped got me right in the feels. I know. You are likely rolling your eyes and balking at the sheer IDEA that a BARBIE movie could be in any way profound. I say to you, you must not REALLY know Barbie then. This really was, if I think about it, in true Barbie fashion. Well done, my lady. Well done.",Barbie
5.0,Monotonous,spinwise,24 July 2023,"I try to be honest and consistent with my opinions. I believe in critical thinking and I hope it is not a dying skill.This film is a grandiose homage to some of the greatest minds our civilization ever produced. Nolan's effort here is sincere but quite lacking in real drama. There is little to separate this from a docu-drama that felt a trifle exasperating.I have an engineering background and was familiar with the basic history of the Manhattan project and the prominent characters. I left the theater slightly disoriented with all of the names and actions of the subsequent political players who dominate over half of the film. That's over 90 minutes.I know this is a story about profound philosophical concepts, but I don't feel they were addressed adequately. The opportunity was missed. Instead we are shown a slightly confusing story of jealousy and persecution. The dawn of the Nuclear age is ultimately something we will always have to deal with. I don't feel this film emphasized that enough.Overall I was disappointed, slightly confused, and fatigued.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Peak Nolan but what's with the sound?,vadim-berman,24 July 2023,"This is how to make a biopic of a complex historical figure without boring the audience! Oppenheimer is my most favourite Nolan's movie so far.The chemistry between the actors is unbelievable, and the visuals are stunning. It's not just wide open spaces of New Mexico, but even elementary particles when Oppenheimer talks about them.I have to say that after the first part where everyone was a Marxist intellectual, the military were a welcome change. The secondary characters are as memorable as the leads. Everyone praises Murphy's performance for a good reason, but Matt Damon's Groves steals the show as a reluctant bridge between the two worlds on a cat-herding assignment gambling an enormous amount on money in the middle of a war. Brief but ominous appearance of Casey Affleck's Boris Pash is probably one of best parts of the movie. Also memorable, even if small, is Tom Conti's Einstein, with his bit of wisdom, and President Truman, played by unrecognizable Gary Oldman.One gripe I'm sure I'm not the only one having: after Tenet, you'd think Nolan would fix his sound problems. Most of the time the dialogue is audible, but there are still parts where I caught myself thinking, ""what did he just say?""",Oppenheimer
10.0,Very well directed,sukhbirmotors,25 July 2023,"It's a fantastic movie with such a perfect combination of artist and the director. In the end couldn't figure out if anything should have been deleted or added. It's so well balanced, it's definitely not a movie for everyone. Don't expect any drama or action sequences. It's a story about a guy a scientist who didn't fall into something and has superpowers. His just a scientist who created something.it's for war nerds or history nerds like me who watch history channel for hours or still get fascinated by WW documentary and stories. There's are so many lives involved, so many people who never got a chance to tell there story. Many people would have lived without knowing about this guy. It's just a very beautiful movie.",Oppenheimer
2.0,Waste of money and time,grbicandrea-32259,20 July 2023,"It's so terrible and doesn't get better with time...Such a disappointment from Nolan. They could've made it much much shorter because the movie is sooo slow. The dialogues are so cringey and bad. The only good thing about this movie is cinematography. The acting is okay but since the whole plot of the movie is really bad it oftentimes comes off as cringey. I really recommend you not to watch this movie because you will only waste your money and time but also your IQ level. There are many unnecessary nudity and sex scenes as well. I was really looking forward to this, so I am very sad to write this.",Oppenheimer
7.0,Barbie,IceCream-57,22 July 2023,"I took my twin daughters to go see this film at the movie theaters with me this weekend. They are 11 and they seemed to enjoy it. The film is geared much to a older crowd, which helped keep them entertained as well as the adults that were in the theater as well. Margot Robbie was great as Barbie she did very good in that role. I love how the film put a modern twist on how people are these days in society- dealing with social anxiety and other disorders. Yet it tells the story of why Barbie was initially invented to began with and what Barbie and Ken stood for. This is a good film to watch with your teenage daughters.",Barbie
10.0,Flabbergasting,xmaspoophat,26 July 2023,"When I went to watch this movie, I went to watch it as the amazing combo, Barbinheimer (Barbie and Oppenheimer). I tried my best to avoid spoilers for both of these movies, and let me just say, going into this movie blind made this a phenomenal experience. The way Stereotypical Barbie changes is a pleasant surprise. And the way this movie deals with problems in modern society upfront and, while admittedly toned down a bit, they're all still there. The plot of this movie makes it a fantastic watch, and I was delighted by not only how the jokes were seamlessly thrown in, but the jokes themselves. This movie wasn't only just Kenough. This was so much more than being just Kenough for the children and adults in the audience. The movie's so self-aware, but it isn't the usual type, this is a type of self-awareness that can lead you to view the world differently. The problems Barbie struggles with aren't unreasonable, they're relatable at heart and spread a good message. This movie is wonderful and I highly recommend it.",Barbie
8.0,You don't get to see so many great actors playing a nerd.,arnoldpoon,20 July 2023,"Despite Oppenheimer's patchy reputation, Nolan has put forward a reasonably fair assessment in this day and age. In the storyline, Louis Strauss acted as a counterweight to the heroic side of the father of the atomic bomb, and went on to reveal in a one-liner the possibility of a malicious side of the calculating physicist. What undergirds the complexity of the assessment harks back to a witty remark made by Albert Einstein, accompanied by a few amazing shots, that will make things 'click' into place. Though I also lament that nothing more comes out of the Prometheus analogy.I do notice the back-and-forth switching between B&O and coloured clips which sets apart, of course, the chronology and also reinstates the mood change. This kind of nudge is helpful. It keeps me aware of the sorry condition that the aspect ratio 1.43:1 is not available where I am, for me to enjoy the enhanced white-hot scene. Pity.To be sure, physicists are smart and most are funny in person like Richard Feynmann. However, some brilliantly written dialogues strike me as out-of-character. Even the entourage of Strauss could drop some vitriolic lines. Someone should have toned it down, not overshoot.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Masterpiece,decnh,23 July 2023,"Oppenheimer was a perfect redemption from Tenet. Murphy performance was masterful. The differentiation between of the black and white and color scenes added tremendous depth to the film. Consciously can say this was the quickest 3 hour movie I have ever watched; no scene felt like it dragged on for too long. There were some quirky dialogue lines throughout the film, but were easily washed out by the sheer beauty of the cinematography and performances by the rest of the characters. Nolan is a known physics lover, which is again evident through this film, but at no point was the viewer ever concerned that they would not understand what was being discussed by the scientists. 10/10. Nolan does it again.",Oppenheimer

The richness of film made the experience all the more authentic.Cillian Murphy's performance is stellar as is RDJ's.I am waiting with baited breath to watch again.Intense. Rich. Atomic.",Oppenheimer

We laughed. We cried and we all danced. But we were lucky to have the best crowd at our showing which made the experience that much more enjoyable! So I highly recommend that you go to a good area to watch it. The people around can either make or break the sweet experience. It has been a long time since I've watched a movie that was actually clean and fun. The story is so entertaining. And the ending was absolutely amazing. The writers did an amazing job and the cast was absolute perfect in every way! God watch it. But get in your Barbie glam first!",Barbie
10.0,Christopher Nolan Has Done It Again,JakeLizarraga,22 July 2023,"Oppenheimer is a meticulously crafted, narrative-driven film that evokes unanswerable moral questions while framing historical events from multiple perspectives - each with its own clashing interests.With its veteran filmmaker at the helm, ensemble talent, daunting soundtrack, and peak cinematography, Oppenheimer manages to not only reach but surpass the highest echelons of the contemporary movie landscape.The captivating tension and pacing of the Trinity sequence coupled with the inherent grandeur of IMAX theaters culminate in an unforgettable experience that I've been fortunate enough to bear witness to.While one could argue the nudity gratuitous and the horses a superfluous highbrow cliché, these minor qualms do not even come close to taking anything away from the cinema mastery displayed in Christopher Nolan's latest entry.Last but not least, Cillian Murphy's emotional, credible, and multi-faceted portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer perfectly ties the whole package together.",Oppenheimer
6.0,No Direction,andermic18,21 July 2023,"The movie was very funny and really enjoyable to laugh at with the full theatre. However, the messages of the movie were the problem. I was never really sure what I was supposed to take away, there was nothing about finding equality or love it was all about how every man cat falls every woman or women can't be anything. It was really silly because there was no accurate reflection of America at any single point except for Barbie getting called a Fascist for no reason by a 14 year old. I enjoyed how they called out women for hating women and how they really tried to preach empowerment and the ability to be anything, but at the same time there was so much resentment and they ended the movie by reinstating hate. The majority of the movie was hating men as much as possible. That's just whatever because what really matters is the story. Well it fell short on that mark and it was really disappointing. The pacing was horrible, the villain won and was pretty irrelevant in the long run, the story was all over the place, and it is totally not for kids. I think the worst part is how disappointed I was at the opportunity to really make something special and it just wasn't. 6 points for all the laughs and fun I had and I would expect 6-7 to be an appropriate rating.",Barbie
9.0,Wonderful,MFC9,21 July 2023,"Didn't really know what to expect from this, but this is one of the best films of the year. Laugh-out-loud funny and heartfelt, Margot and Ryan Gosling throw themselves head first into Barbie and Ken like some kind of Zoolander/Legally Blonde/Lego Movie hybrid, but far more intelligently written.Jam packed with in-jokes, sly references and even a Mattel-censored F-bomb, Barbie is relentlessly entertaining from start to finish. Most of the satire will fly over kids' heads, as we had a theatre-full of Belgrave's finest letting their vile offspring literally run riot under the screen.Luckily, the movie was so good we kept our teacher voices to ourselves. Over to Oppenheimer on Sunday. 9/10.",Barbie
9.0,masterpiece psychological study in personal and power relations,nevermore_heart_collector,28 July 2023,"The movie is a masterpiece psychological study in personal and power relations.So, this could easily have been a Paul Thomas Anderson movie.It can be considered some sort of a ""Citizen Kane"" coming from Christopher Nolan.We see some stellar acting performances.Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Are certainly Oscar bound.Even Matt Damon finds his niche in the all-American, Boston-MIT produced general.However, I want to emphasize Gary Oldman as Harry Truman.Gary Oldman gives a two minutes master lecture in method acting.I guess it would help if you some knowledge of the historical context.",Oppenheimer
5.0,All surface but no feeling,darrenhrose,29 July 2023,"Nolan rarely does empathy well but this is a soulless three hours of men mumbling at one another. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt are wasted and portrayed as damaged souls. Scenes come and go barely registering on your conscience. Watching this movie is a bit like thinking back to you time in school where you were forced by your teachers to watch educational videos which were kind of okay but you'd rather be playing Lego or riding your bike. That's what watching Oppenheimer is like. It's like a three hour lecture with a bit of sex thrown in. Yes, it's a competent artistic film but that doesn't mean it's that good.",Oppenheimer
9.0,A great movie for all grown ups and teens,walidoo,20 July 2023,"I can only recommend to see this joyful movie with an incredible cast.If you like fun, creativity, colors and a great plot that is both entertaining and thoughtful this is one of the best movies you can see.Songs are OK but choreographies are amazing. Everything in the movie is weird but in the best sense because it is unlike any other movie. Ryan Gosling plays both a brilliant regular guy and kinda stupid at the same time, which is super cute and sensitive. While the movie is full of intentional stupidity and fun, it makes us man rethink manhood, not really because of the feminist discourse - which is a bit too much present here - but in more subtile way because of Gosling's character reactions and evolution throughout the movie.It is also a movie about American culture at its best : Barbieland is a reflection of America and vice-versa. The plot nourishes itself brilliantly from that reflection and challenges both men and women's conception of our dreams. Consumerism, business, idealism, self deprecative humour, all ingredients are there. The only downside we can find to this movie is the labyrinth style plot that is too stretched sometimes and unnecessary. More importantly this makes it unsuitable for younger audience. Thank you Mattel for this piece of fun !!",Barbie
9.0,Oppenheimer: A Gripping Tale with Stellar Performances and Atmospheric Depth - A 9/10 Cinematic Journey,user-68-77889,20 July 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" is a captivating and compelling film that leaves a lasting impact. I thoroughly enjoyed it, particularly the outstanding performances that brought the characters to life. The music enhanced the overall experience, and the story was gripping from start to finish, keeping me engrossed throughout.The film's portrayal of the creator of the atomic bomb, J. Robert Oppenheimer, was done with an impeccable sense of mood, capturing the complexities of his journey. However, one minor drawback for me was the abundance of characters, which at times made it a bit challenging to fully connect with each one.Despite this, ""Oppenheimer"" stands as a powerful cinematic experience, earning a solid 9/10 rating. It skillfully delves into history while showcasing exceptional performances and creating an immersive atmosphere that lingers long after the credits roll.",Oppenheimer
7.0,Gretta Gereig Approached Mattel,j_kurzyn,28 July 2023,"Just want to get this out of the way: Greta Gerwig approached Mattel and wrote the film. Not the other way around.This movie is super fun. Where this movie shines is the acting, production design, and soundtrack. The script is dense with jokes however it feels like it's trying to be too much all at once. The big monolgue was solid though and the subplot with the mother and daughter was emotional and authentic.Regardless, some people will be offened by or feel left out because, for example, the trans representation (or lack thereof). It is very binary but the film can't be everything to everyone and Mattel I imagine doesn't want to get involved in the culture wars. Whether that's an asset or liability is yours to determine.Overall it's enjoyable but like Christopher Nolan who also has a film competing with it, Barbie tries to be too complicated and vague in order to seem clever. That being said, it hits A LOT on the head. I recommend.",Barbie

10.0,Most Critical Film Of All Time,lolpopenguin,21 July 2023,"I've heard that a big deterrent to watch this movie is it's 3 hour run time, however, I believe that those 3 hours make up one of the most important films in cinema history. Oppenheimer is a hard-to-swallow biopic on one of mankind's most important men to ever live, and every second of this film is nothing short of accurate history (from big factual sources like the book ""American Prometheus"" which in itself is the biggest inspiration for this film) combined with Christopher Nolan's remarkable story telling. This is a movie you do NOT want to miss. Also, don't forget to watch it on its intended format (70mm or IMAX)",Oppenheimer
6.0,Great potential but messy closure,ramon-vermij,24 July 2023,"Up to 80% of the storyline the film was great and tapped into essential topics of personal development and gender identities, reflecting and criticising society. The cast and characters had flair in the right amount of depth and dimensionality as well as chemistry amongst them. Also great that by the time the choreographed dancing scene(s) came in, the viewer had gotten the chance to properly care about what had been building up and then, the songs had real impact. It made for some good fun and laughs.As for the remaining 20%, it felt the makers did not know how to tie everything up and went for a shallow symbolic move which was very blurry and loose.",Barbie
3.0,WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE SEEING????,661jda,26 July 2023,"This is not a great movie - when you get down to it, it's not even a good movie. It's a popcorn movie at best. The best thing it has going for it? Margot Robbie as Barbie: she does channel the role well and when her world turns upside down, you genuinely feel sorry for her. At the other end of the scale - Ryan Gosling as Ken. Gosling is good at stretching into roles, but no matter what - Ken was an androgenous doll and Gosling can't stretch the role anything more than that. He looks like a character out of ZOOLANDER and whenever he is on the screen, i was cringing in my seat. There are definitely funny moments: my favorite? When Ken runs into the ocean to surf. Definitely a woman's movie from the first preach to the final cast roll - it got old fast and the screenplay didn't seem to have much substance after the ""I am woman"" speeches. I thought it was me, but there was a lot of kids in the theatre and they all appeared to be bored as well. Sorry Greta => This is not your ticket to the Oscars.",Barbie
7.0,It's Barbie and it's Ken!,chand-suhas,21 July 2023,"Barbie is living a perfect life in her Barbie world filled with Barbies and Kens. Without the fear of change and the assurance of perfection, Barbie gets through the day partying until she starts thinking about death. Fearing malfunction, she is asked to visit the Real World to find her human pal to resolve the issue and get back to her perfect life. Ken follows her to the Real World where both come across patriarchy, which overwhelms them. When Barbie returns back to her world, she realizes what she is about to lose and how Barbie along with the other Barbies, couple of humans and an Allan, work together to save their world forms the story.Initially, it takes a bit of time to get used to the narrative as well as the humor. Good thing is it doesn't take much time to get me invested in the world of Barbie and Ken. The perfect casting ensured the smooth flow of the story and the likes of Kate McKinnon, Will Ferrell took care of elevating a simple scene with their impeccable comic timing. It is the final act, where Greta Gerwig proved why she is among the best to handle mother-daughter relationship or to even narrate women.There are several scenes that earns instant laughter and those scenes are cleverly handled. I did expect atleast a couple of more dance numbers. Ryan Gosling easily became pick of the lot and Margot Robbie owned her character as Barbie. The monologue scene with the mother worked for me and ofcourse the Ken's breakdown towards the end. If the first hour provides genuine humor, it is the second half that truly make it a thorough entertainer blending humor with emotions.",Barbie

Honestly going to the cinema was an unbelievable experience even when you realize that no computer effects were used in the film so it's really incredible. The cast is so well cast and the resemblance to real actors is just amazing. Cillian Murphy should deserve an award for this film because he played the role so well , I hope fiom will be properly appreciated .

7.0,"Pleasantly surprised, but maybe it's a bit too much",Limbo81,28 July 2023,"I went to see this movie without even seeing the trailer first. I'm a 42 yo man and people kept posting stuff about this movie on social media, so when a friend asked me to go watch it, I said yes...I was expecting some kind of dumb movie, but this is not. It appeals to teenagers but also to an older audience. I loved the sense of humor, Mattel was sometimes laughing at themselves too. I found that very nicely done. The acting is amazing. However I liked the first part of the movie more than the second one. It starts to analyze the patriarchy a bit too heavily for my taste. They want to make it clear that this is a feminist movie. They want to clear Barbie's image of the stereotypes she's been associated with for decades: she's not a blonde and skinny perfect bimbo girl. Barbie is a feminist, she represents empowered women. I keep questioning myself about this point of view: little girls have been associating the idea of beauty with Barbie for so long, so my idea of Barbie has been quite the opposite throughout my life. I find it hard to accept it.Now let's talk about Ken. He only exists because Barbie exists. In Barbie Land he counts nothing. There is a deep criticism toward the patriarchy which I can understand but goes slightly too far for my taste...",Barbie
10.0,A Restrained Masterpiece,Revuer223,23 July 2023,"We know that the bomb worked. We know history. But the weeds of it, we do not.The writing, the acting, and, most of all, the restraint made this movie into a trie masterpiece.And I really do want to emphasize the restraint in my review. A studio exec or a less experienced director could have added in a scene where the bomb actually gets used In Hiroshima and Nagasaki. They would have made a spectacle out of it with CGI.But Nolan did not. Nolan trusted his writing and the ability of the actors to deliver the guttural horror of the atomic destruction in relative silence. Even without showing the physical destruction, the destructive nature of the weapon becomes too clear in more ways than one.After you see the movie, you truly realize that it was destructive to humanity in more ways than one. You get the sense that it was a spiritual and moral destruction, a blasphememous grasp at power.Now, thee movie doesn't say all that in a speech. But the acting and the writing makes it too clear.A phenomenal movie that all should watch.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Not for everyone!,denzildas,22 July 2023,"See, Oppenheimer is a movie which is about the late scientist's life J Robert Oppenheimer. The story is completely based on his life and nothing's changed from it, if you're expecting an entertainer or a subtle of impressing moments then it's not a cup of tea for everyone. We all know that Nolan's movies like The Batman Trilogy, Inception, Interstellar, Prestige, Tenet and many more movies like that is kinda entertaining, but the point to be noted here is, the movie is entirely different from these movies i've mentioned. From an honest reaction as a movie lover, not as a Nolan fanboy. The first half is literally boring i ain't gonna lie about that. But from the second half the movie completely changes things becomes impressive. But what i understood from this movie is, if you miss a single scene from this movie. You'll get confused as hell. Because one of my friend who came with me was yawning and slept for some minutes. He couldn't keep up with the movie. And I've seen the movie twice first i saw it in an IMAX screen and second i saw it in a normal 4K ATMOS screen. The explosion scenes were pretty good in IMAX compared to the normal, so i wanna say is, if you want a great experience, IMAX is the best choice than 4DX. And if you are expecting Oppenheimer to be a entertaining movie like other Nolan movies then you are wrong. And if you watch with that taste or a mindset you'll feel so embarrassed and will leave the theatre asap.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Just Brilliant!,coolcalmcreative,28 July 2023,"Just Brilliant, so intense from start to finish so much so you don't even realise you've been sitting for 3 hrs it's does not feel like that at allThe only slight issue I had was the trinity test explosion scene it was all leading up to that and I feel like I was underwhelmed I know he doesn't like using cgi but I feel like the silence then the effects didn't represent what I thought a atomic bomb would be like and didn't go on very long either, perhaps cgi would have been helpful to truely blow us away as I knew this scene had to illustrate what has now changed for all of us and the dramatic consequences of pressing the button and using oneOther than that utterly brilliant, highly recommended!",Oppenheimer
9.0,Get off your couch and go to Barbie Land!,nicholasrhettlever,22 July 2023,"Storyline: 8.5- Great story, could've been fleshed out in some areas to have even more overall connection, but it makes overall sense. A little silly at times; but I'm not complaining, I mean it is a story about Barbie. Pacing was good and easy to follow. It is, in my opinion, the perfect movie length, at an hour and 54 minutes.Cinematography: 8.75- There are some really great cinematic shots throughout the film. Very clear distinction between ""Barbie Land"" and ""The Real World"".Acting- 9.75- The acting was wonderful. Every actor pulled their weight and shined. Many comedic moments that will have you laughing nearly to tears. Also, There are serious moments that are executed well in such a way that may even bring you to tears (as they did to me).Music Music Soundtrack: 9.5- Overall, extremely strong movie music soundtrack. All of the songs align with the theme of what is happening during the current scenes & the storyline. Great modern day popular artists chosen, including Lizzo, Dua Lippa, Nicki Minaj, Ice Spice, Sam Smith, Tame Impala, and others. The weakest song (and I mean from a vocal standpoint) is the one sung by Ryan Gosling.Choreography- 9- There is a fair amount of choreography in the film, and there is an all-Ken dancing scene that is phenomenal.Overall: 9.1/10.",Barbie

I ended up crying as the credits rolled just because I felt like all the emotions I couldn't put into words and no one could ever understand were said in this film. This is a movie for everyone, not just women, it makes us reflect about power roles and how we should all work together towards a more equal world for all.Unlike what some people might believe it is not ""anti men"" the whole point of Ken's story line is how he learns toxic masculinity is dangerous, not only for women but for men as well and just end up causing harm. In the end he learns he is more than just a partner and must find meaning in his life being his own person. I don't understand in what world that message is ""anti men"".",Barbie

The way Barbie moves, walks, drinks, acts?? Perfection.Also surprisingly emotional, I didn't expect to cry during a movie about a doll.

10.0,Superb presentation,budhaditya-b,20 July 2023,"Just out after watching this movie. Nolan is maturing well and how. The story telling has become simpler (vis-a-vis Prestige for example :P). Has an Amadeus touch to the story line. Cinematography, lighting and camera work is superb and lends itself well to the story telling. Nolan remains customer obsessed as ever, treating his audience with intellectual respect. The actors are extremely good and the best compliment to them is that you don't feel them. Only thing which could be better was the music.Science (Quantum physics) serves as the background color of the movie but it is neither necessary or expected to understand all of it nuances to understand the movie. Don't get too bothered by the science jargons unless you are interested.",Oppenheimer
8.0,"Super cast, super film",clarkie08,23 July 2023,"After reading the reviews prior to seeing the film, it felt as if this flick has divided cinema-goers. Ok, let's deal with the obvious - cast, cinematography and art of telling a story well are very much order of the day, but did it need to be 3hr sitting, probably not.You'd be hard pushed to find a fault with the build but as many have pointed out, the bio pic is more than events of WW2, it questions the fabric of the human soul, morals and ethics along with political and professional upmanship.All in all a super film that proved to be a fascinating watch.

Add to it the fun movie opening rip off of 2001 Space Odyssey, it's hard to say that this is a very original movie. However, Margot Robbie brings it home and grounds the emotional side of the movie beautifully. The colour palette and the messages are worthwhile, ballsy directing and old for this role but excellent Gosling make it worth seeing. Will we remember this movie few years from now? No. But doesn't mean it's not worth seeing.",Barbie
10.0,Cinematographic Masterpiece,nav_lohia,22 July 2023,"If you are aware of basic events of life of Oppenheimer and are not expecting a super spicy movie with loads of drama but beautiful cinematography, This movie is for you.Everybody knew the story of life of Oppenheimer but Cristopher Nolan brings it in a different form on big screen. It is a heavy - dialogue movie where some scenes may look a little stretchy and off putting but believe me movie never bores.The main highlight is the trinity test and movie sums up after that. You may not have a super positive review before trinity test scene but it all changes after that where the beautiful acting of cilian murphy shockes you.In end, every actor was not good not bad but perfect. Best actor for me in the movie was RDJ who just does a super new role. Even if you are not aware of Chris Nolan's work, movie is a one-time must see, even only for the cinematography experience.",Oppenheimer
10.0,MASTERPIECE,yuvarajmotakatlanaga,28 July 2023,"Perfect Nolan's treat Worth watching it. Cillian Murphy's screen presence and Downey's performance nailed it. Kept the audience on their seat for the whole duration. Even if it looks like a documentary film it really deals with a lot starting off from Oppenheimer till the bomb. Nolan did his magic again with the cast and in techincal terms. Don't miss this epic art.The cast is also AMAZING with Cillian Murphy delivering the performance of his carrer as Oppenheimer, esentially becoming him, and pretty much securing himself an Oscar nomination for best lead actor! Robert Downey Junior also gives one of his best performances, reminding us all that despite 10 years as Iron man, he can still act!",Oppenheimer
10.0,Quite possibly the best Nolan movie.,saadhasan-36609,22 July 2023,"In Nolan's filmography, which very few directors in history can rival, OPPENHEIMER possibly stands out as the best, and certainly most pure form of cinema. Give Cillian Murphy the Oscar NOW.Let me preface this by saying, I don't think this movie is for everyone. It's not your usual Nolan suspense/thriller blockbuster movie, and I feel like a lot of people who gave it negative reviews went into this movie with Interstellar/Inception/The Dark Knight type expectations. This is not a movie about The Atomic Bomb or The Manhattan Project. It's called OPPENHEIMER for a reason. And for others, it just may not be their cup of tea, which is totally fine. Maybe the subject matter isn't that gripping to them, or maybe the big science/political terminologies turned them off.Regardless, I find this movie to be one of the best cinema experiences I have ever had. I myself am not a big student of history, but this movie is crafted in such a brilliant way that it's hard to keep your eyes off the screen. 3 hours flew by so quickly, and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The acting by everyone was superb, but special shouts need to be given to Cillian Murphy, who really should win the Best Lead Actor Oscar, and RDJ who most definitely will be nominated for the Best Supporting Actor. Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh and Matt Damon too were outstanding.Prior to me watching the film, I browsed the reviews and many said that the ""courtroom drama"" that follows the Trinity test is a bit boring, but honest to God I feel like that was the best part of the movie, or atleast as good as what came before. It flows seamlessly, and the tension between the characters is palpable. It tugs at your emotions and really does a fantastic job of putting the audience in the mind and heart of Oppenheimer.Visually, this movie is jaw-dropping, especially coupled with the fact that there are exactly 0 CGI shots. It's a ridiculous feat of filmmaking that only Nolan could do. The build-up to the Trinity test will have your heart in your mouth throughout, and the eventual release is terrifyingly beautiful.However I do have one teeny tiny criticism - towards the middle of the movie I felt like we were jumping from scene to scene way too quick, and at times it was slightly tough to keep track. I know this was purposely done in a bid to ramp up the tension (which it did!), but I felt it could have been paced slightly better.And the ending. OH MY GOD THE ENDING. Towards the end I was so curious as to how this movie ends, and holy balls Nolan really hit the mark - it ties the whole story together poetically. Such a beautiful way to go out.A masterpiece by every definition of the word. Quite possibly Nolan's best work.10/10.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Offensive Portrayal of the Bhagavad Gita,supra-57769,22 July 2023,"Nolan's direction in is truly remarkable. In a non-linear chronological order, he weaves together the two timelines, offering viewers Oppenheimer's subjective experience in vivid color and others consequential perspective in black and white. This duality brilliantly portrays Oppenheimer's personal struggles in color(scenes from the first person) and the far-reaching impact of his actions in black and white (scenes from others points of view)....Indeed, individual perceptions of color and its symbolic representation can vary greatly,.,..I gave ""OPPENHEIMER"" a 8-star rating due to its offensive portrayal of the Bhagavad Gita, which disappointed me as an Indian viewer. Additionally, I expected more in-depth coverage of the history of the neutron bombardment, as the film's depiction was too brief... As a biographical drama it's really enjoyable, especially for science enthusiasts. However, some may find the negotiation scenes lengthy and tiresome. For fans of Christopher Nolan's cinematography, this film is worth watching to see how he presents the scenario in a 3-hour timeframe🕓🕖....",Oppenheimer
10.0,Spellbinding,sugsue,29 July 2023,"Though (brilliantly) closely observed, the movie is riveting. Even though you know the events that are going to happen--Oppenheimer and colleagues develop the bomb, the bomb is tested and then unleashed on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Oppenheimer has regrets, he is subjected to one hearing, and his antagonist is subjected to another--you don't know how it's going to happen. You don't know the mindset of the people involved or the steps that lead inevitably and inexorably to the world as we know it now: deeply conflicted, riddled with pockets of willful blindness, and horribly polarized.The movie puts you in the shoes of one of the most tortured and consequential human beings ever to grace the planet, whose thoughts, life, and dealings were far more nuanced than many of us have understood. How can Oppenheimer, a man of community-minded and pacific sensibilities, justify his willingness and even eagerness to build the bomb? The idea that the Germans might build one first goes only so far. And then the time comes when Germany has been defeated and the question remains only of how to bring Japan, which has only conventional weapons, to heel. The movie shows Oppenheimer give a rationale for detonating the bomb on the country that seems naive--granted that the appearance is retrospective. How much did he really believe it? The movie forces us to ponder the question and yet not resolve it, because perhaps Oppenheimer didn't.Cillian Murphy plays the tortured, reserved and yet passionate and fierce, Oppenheimer hauntingly and exquisitely. The many other characters are both written and played with intricate shading as well. You are in those rooms with them. The use of the hearings as the movie's scaffolding and the interleaving of them with the events they concern is sheer art.",Oppenheimer

9.0,Exceptional,craigkeiran-62574,27 July 2023,"Such a captivating film throughout. Theres a lot of information and dialouge to this film but each scene is short and fast paced, like it resembled the pressure and urgency of their task. The short, fast paced scenes keep you interested and on the edge of your seat as the film builds and builds up to the point of the test. My only critism is the explosion itself, although the sound was okay, it didn't feel as dramatic as there were a lot of loud scenes leading up to the explosion so it felt underwhelming in comparison. I also feel that the visuals of the bomb was slightly underwhelming. However, I believe Nolan didn't want to use any CGI for the explosion so considering it was done with real explosives, it was still impressive. Nolan never fails to suprise me with his films. A must watch.",Oppenheimer
1.0,Delete this movie - not worth it,romanchernobrivets,24 July 2023,"This film should not exist: bad storytelling, awful casting and boring concept. I have a degree in physics and I like long deep movies, but this movie is nonsense. Story could be told in 15 mins, not 3 hours. Wasted my time on 50 identical man in old hats arguing about nothing in desert. It is like a bad documentary. How did you spend that amount money on this? Maybe if you are a fan of Oppenheimer's life, you can find this movie interesting. And everybody from the movie crew is faking successful start - I am sure all of them are laughing at the audience who have to watch this movie for 3 hours. And I wish Christofer Nolan good luck on the next episode - ""Oppenheimer 2: Oppy cannot decide what sauce to buy in supermarket"" - it could be 4 hours. And ""Oppenheimer 3: Oppy arguing with his neighbours"" - ideally for 5 hours. Peace for all - I don't want to start a nuclear war in comments - just dropping a little thing :)",Oppenheimer
6.0,Cute but shallow,steveinadelaide,24 July 2023,"So I headed to the cinema to watch Barbie, the new live-action adaptation of the beloved doll franchise. I had high hopes. Unfortunately, it fell short. Barbie takes us on a journey, with Margot Robbie portraying ""Stereotypical"" Barbie as she leaves her world of Barbieland and enters the Real World. She encounters friends, overcomes challenges, and discovers important lessons about herself and others. Barbie doesn't always hit the mark while attempting to blend comedy, drama and fantasy elements. The plot feels predictable and filled with clichés, and the theme and tone are sometimes inconsistent and confusing. The acting and characters come across as stereotypes (something expected in Barbieland but not in the Real World).Nevertheless, Greta Gerwig's direction is skilful and imaginative; Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt's music is catchy and uplifting; Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is vibrant with a burst of colours. The movie also incorporates intriguing symbolism and production design by contrasting Barbie's sparkly world with the realism of the Real World. The animation breathes life into Barbie's world on screen. Amidst it all are some moments accompanied by clever dialogue-particularly from Ken (played by Ryan Gosling), who, as you would expect, serves as Barbie's trusty sidekick, desperately wanting to be noticed and appreciated by Barbie.I had some issues with the movie because it only scratched the surface when exploring its themes. Throughout the story, Barbie touched on topics like death, unattainable perfection, gender roles, body image and self-esteem. However, it merely skimmed over these issues superficially, like snacking on junk food instead of having a substantial meal.Barbie isn't a masterpiece. It's not a disaster, either. It's an entertaining film for kids and adults. The movie attempts to convey a message about embracing oneself and accepting others. It doesn't do so convincingly or in an original way. It left me feeling amused and bored.Cute but shallow.",Barbie

10.0,Classic cinematography is back,prapathrall-97077,29 July 2023,"A work of art from this caliber was much needed in this current cinema industry. It shows simple yet incredible filmwork, without unnecessary effects and the story touches the heart and soul - something that many of us in the audeince haven't experienced for years ""thanks"" to Hollywood's recent movies. Above all it makes us think. Think about our personal missions in life, the responsibility for our actions and the injustices of this world. A briliant and chaotic mix of scientific genuis, humblness, lust for power, greed and treachery - all put carefully together in an accurate historical context. In a word - a move away from the cancerous virtue signalling Hollywood and striaght back into the world of classic cinematography by Nolan.",Oppenheimer

The laughs and the jokes were only a small portion of the emotions we felt we could just let out, it was emotional in the best way possible and was a moment that i am thankful i could share with my bestfriend.

3.0,Ryan gosling is the best part of this movie,ryfletch,21 July 2023,"This movie is a feminist fever dream that teaches young girls that they will never be successful in the world as long as men exist, and that men are horrible, ironically Ken played by Ryan Gosling is the best part of this movie, bringing more laughs than anything else.The movie gets upset at the real world because women don't choose to take on more physical or stressful jobs, and then says that the reason they don't take these jobs is because of men, Men are this men are that, men publicly grope women, every single one, and every woman is perfect no matter how obese or weird they are. It's a waste of time for anyone not watching the movie Ironically, go watch Oppenheimer instead.",Barbie
10.0,Really good,fgbreyesus,21 July 2023,"As expected ""Barbie"" is A lot of happy fun! 💕 Greta Gerwig is a director I've really come to appreciate & LOVE. Greta is one of the most wholesome filmmakers working today. ""Lady bird"" is my favourite coming of age story in film and similarly, I have to say right off the bat-this film is ridiculously hilarious. Tongue and cheek? Sure. Just exceptionally written characters also. The quirks between Margot Robbie (Barbie) & Ryan Gosling (Ken) are just magic together on screen.Margot is probably the only person to have played ""Barbie"" as she is so perfect in the role with everything she does. Mr Gosling (KEN) is eating up all the screen time and will also have you gasping for air at some of his one liners and facial expressions.I should mention that Issa Rae & America Ferrera are just so awesome a-swell in this world. Now! Having grown up in the 90s and seeing how popular the toys were, I was apart of the ""Barbie"" crazed era in primary school. It's really cool knowing everyone has another summer blockbuster coming that they can be truely excited about. Really hope that everyone can give ""Barbie"" a chance, because it has a lot of HEART.Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" is nothing more then a delightful trip down memory lane, filled with what felt like a stellar cast and production value. Furthermore this film was filled with outstanding characters, dance choreography and musical numbers.",Barbie

Sound design was fabulous even though there were times when dialogues was overpowered by music.The movie takes you on a journey of Robert Oppenheimer and oh my, it was just amazing.The casting choices were nothing short of brilliant. Christian Bale's portrayal of Oppenheimer was nothing less than extraordinary.

I still see the film too. This time I fell asleep and I only woke up for the last 20 Minutes. It looked pretentious and boring too, Murphy was never my favourite actor and this film didn't help either, what I saw.I also realised why I don't normally like Nolan's works apart from Inception.

As with all Christopher Nolan movies, the filmography was excellent, audio shook you and really brought up emotions of despair and beauty in certain scenes. I watched this in an IMAX theater so all the sensory effects with amplified. The actors were amazing too.But a word of warning, please go in with the correct expectations. This is a 3 hour long movie that portrays the life of Oppenheimer through the good and bad.The only gripe I had with the movie was that the last hour could have been shortened to about 20 minutes, but that's more of a personal subjective preference.Despite the tiring 3 hour watch, its an overall an outstanding movie and will definitely stand amongst the classics against the test of time.",Oppenheimer

10.0,Best movie I ever seen in my entire life.,alnaqbi-90544,26 July 2023,"I wanted to watch this on the release day, but my brother wanted to watch it with me and he said he will take some time. So, my friend saw it on the release day and told me it's the worst movie he ever saw, but I knew better than to believe him, and said that he might not have understood the movie since this is the first movie of Nolan he watches.I've seen it yesterday on 11:00 pm on IMAX, and I never even felt of sleepiness. It was always gripping, thrilling, and the music is one of the best I ever heard in a movie my entire life, even better than interstellar. The plot twist is the best executed plot twist in a movie, even though it might have not been the best plot twist specifically, but the execution made it the best for me, the music when (spoiler here) they revealed Strauss never liked Oppenheimer was literally the best as well.If you claim to not have liked the movie, go watch it again on IMAX and try to focus, because if you haven't liked it, you didn't even understand what was going on.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Nolan's best so far,shoebsaad,21 July 2023,"As a devoted fan of historical dramas, I can confidently say that ""Oppenheimer"" is an absolute masterpiece! Christopher Nolan has once again delivered an awe-inspiring cinematic experience that leaves the audience spellbound from start to finish.Casting Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer was a stroke of genius. His portrayal of the conflicted scientist was both nuanced and emotionally charged. He brilliantly captured Oppenheimer's intellect, determination, and moral dilemmas, making the character come alive on the screen. Murphy delivers an Oscar-worthy performance. Also, Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss did an excellent performance. This is by far Downey's best performance, and he also deserves an Oscar nomination. The supporting cast is equally praiseworthy, with outstanding performances from Emily Blunt, Matt Damon, and Florence Pugh.From the first frame, the film immerses its audience in a spellbinding narrative that perfectly balances historical accuracy and captivating storytelling. The attention to detail in depicting the era is unparalleled, transporting viewers back to the 1940s and the intensity of the Manhattan Project. The meticulous recreation of the Los Alamos laboratory and the wartime atmosphere adds an authentic touch, making the viewers feel like eyewitnesses to a defining moment in history.The cinematography deserves special commendation, as it brilliantly captures both the beauty of the New Mexico landscape and the intensity of the laboratory's scientific endeavor. The haunting musical score adds an extra layer of depth, heightening the emotional impact of critical moments throughout the movie.""Oppenheimer"" stands as a testament to the power of cinema to educate, entertain, and provoke introspection. It expertly delves into the complex interplay of science, politics, and human morality, reminding the profound implications that scientific discoveries can have on the world.Christopher Nolan has once again proven why he is one of the greatest directors of our time.

10.0,Leave some time for thinking after the movie,registerhad,23 July 2023,"What can I say, its a piece of art no doubt about it. Picture, sound, colors, actors line up, all of it makes an excellent movie. But what you would find your yourself is that after the movie your brain is gonna go crazy. Crazy because the topic, the execution and sequence of how Nolan presented what was a real life event and the consequences of it that we inherited today is gonna make you think a lot. I can easily say that many movies can be excellent, but only few can be exceptional and Oppenheimer is one of them. Watch it on cinema IMAX, and please do leave some time to think about the last words of that movie, maybe after all art can change the world through each one of us.",Oppenheimer
5.0,"If Nolan was not directed this movie, then how would you rate it?",ehsankarimy,23 July 2023,"I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan, and I was really excited to see his latest film, Oppenheimer. I drove 45 minutes to the theater to see it in IMAX, and I was prepared to be blown away.Unfortunately, I was not. I found the movie to be boring, slow-paced, and visually underwhelming. The explosions looked like they were from free stock video websites, and the acting was not particularly good.I think the main problem with the movie is that it is too long and too ambitious. Nolan tries to cram too much into the film, and as a result, it feels bloated and unfocused. The film also suffers from Nolan's trademark convoluted editing style, which makes it difficult to follow at times.If Nolan was not the director of this film, I would probably give it a 2 out of 5 stars. It is not a terrible movie, but it is definitely not one of Nolan's best.",Oppenheimer

If you compare it with other Nolan movies you might find this weak but in this genre you can;t do much .Emily Blunt have some strong scenes. Second half is too paced and good. First half is good and slow but you might not get some stuffs if you miss those conversations in first half. I would have given 9.5 but since i m Nolan fan so i am bit biased here.",Oppenheimer
8.0,La Vie en Rose,dromasca,22 July 2023,"I'm not one of those people who feel the need to apologize for watching 'Barbie'. In my opinion there are no bad movie genres, there are only good movies and bad movies. And the cinema is also popular entertainment, and buying a big bowl of popcorn and sitting in the air-conditioned theater to watch a musical comedy that features some of the most talented actors of the moment can't be the worst thing on a hot summer day. 'Barbie', Greta Gerwig's film did not make me regret the decision to watch it for at least three quarters of its duration.Barbie lives in an ideal world called Barbieland. Actually, I should use the plural, but I don't really know how, because it's not just about the blonde doll we all know, but about all the incarnations she has received over the decades - blondes and brunettes, with white, yellow, black or other skin colors, thinner or bigger. The multiple Barbies have the most diverse professions, from doctor to Nobel laureate writer, from astronaut to president of the United States. Ultimately, the Barbie universe was imagined to give courage and self-confidence to little girls and instill in them the idea that anything is possible. There are also boys, they are generally called Ken, but their purpose is to be the Barbies' (asexual) partners when those are willing to pay attention to them. The introduction to the film is excellent, with a quote from Kubrick's 'A Space Odyssey' and voiceovers narrated by Helen Mirren. When stereotypical blonde Barbie starts getting into trouble, the source is in the real world. Barbie must face reality and the conflict between universes is inevitable. The real world is not like the ideal world and the mixture of them will cause a revolution in Barbieland that will not necessarily be in the right direction. The awakening to reality or, if you will, the humanization of Barbie comes at a price.'Barbie' - the movie works well most of the time, especially when the focus is on the comedic and musical side and the message is integrated into the entertainment. The production is excellent. The sets, the costumes, the cinematography will surely receive Academy Awards nominations, and in some categories 'Barbie' may be the winner. The soundtrack reminds at some points fragments from the history of the pop and ballad genres of the 70s and 80s. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are excellent in the lead roles and I wouldn't be surprised if Barbie dolls borrow their faces (if they haven't already). The messages are well-punched and come across the screen quite well - genuine and fake feminism and the way Barbie products reflect society's conception of the place, role and appearance of women, the more or less camouflaged misogyny of contemporary society, corporations with their seemingly socially aligned messages camouflaging capitalist greed. All of this is well dosed and combined with what happens on screen until the final part of the film, when either the writers took themselves a little too seriously, or they did not have enough inspiration and instead of continuing to infuse the dissolved messages into entertainment they resorted to rhetoric and created an ending that I found forced and didactic. 'Barbie' was worth seeing for the fun part, for the colours, music and humour. When playing with dolls it is good not to be overly serious.",Barbie

But the film is still awesome, Christopher Nolan never fails to impress me just like he did in interstellar, inception, and the prestige.

8.0,"Drop the kids at Oppenheimer the adults can see a real, philosophical masterpiece",NewgenW,19 July 2023,"I'm not someone who often watches comedies, so they don't make me laugh much, but if they all became as funny as Barbie, I might give it another go.Because I really laughed out loud during the film.It did away perfectly with the comedy and the moralizing, a bit deeper, philosophical stuff.Of course, the soundtrack is top-notch, the sets are breathtaking and there's Ryan Gosling: the main reason I came.In addition to all that, this film is a good critic of patriarchal rule, without overdoing it. It questions gender roles in a fluid way, and brings existential questions to the fore.By the way, I don't understand the opinions of those who didn't like the film because it promoted feminism. Whereas Barbie is literally an invention designed to make women feel as important as men in society, to break down stereotypes and glorify gender equality.Ok whatever, go and see it, it's worth it.",Barbie

Everything was gorgeous, the actors were perfect for their roles, the music was awesome (i'm just ken is top tier), the plot was super interesting, the outfits were amazing and truly connected with barbies through history, which leads me to say that is also a historical movie that shows the different barbies that existed or/and got cancelled through the decades.It think it's a movie that has a significant impact after watching, is highkey emotional and touch themes that probably a 7 year old will not understand. I recommend this movie mainly for adults because it is related to subjects that we experience everyday mixed with nostalgy (I cried twice during the film) and great sense of humor. But if you are a kid, you can also watch it, even though you will not undestand it a 100%, is visually pleasant!",Barbie
10.0,Greta shows real power of woman in Barbie,GusherPop,21 July 2023,"Greta Gerwig's Barbie explores creation myths in Barbieland, a parallel universe populated by Mattel dolls. The director uses the toy conglomerate's vast archive and successful products as tools to create a rich and weird material. The movie is a clever send-up of Barbie dolls and their legacy, featuring light-hearted jokes that poke fun at Mattel, the doll's lore, and the contradictions of our sexist society. The director's storytelling is impressive, and the film's humor is both lighthearted and chuckle-worthy. Gerwig's Barbieland, created by Sarah Greenwood and Jacqueline Durran, is a pink fever dream with funky compositions by Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt, bubblegum anthems by Dua Lipa, Nicki Minaj, and Ice Spice. The film features plastic trees and identical two-story Barbie dream homes, with flying being the preferred mode of transportation. The production design and costuming are exceptional, showcasing Gerwig's passion for details and her ability to create a dreamlike world. Barbieland is a feminist utopia in which Barbies serve as presidents, Supreme Court members, doctors, physicists, Nobel prize winners, and cancer cures. The dolls are not structurally different from our world, but they are represented by political fantasy and decade-dependent what-ifs. Barbie has gone to space, could vote, and own property before many human women, and her appearance has changed to mirror society's beauty politics. The representational doll has become an extension of political fantasy, reflecting the beauty politics of society. Gerwig features a cast of Barbies, including Issa Rae, Emma Mackey, Alexandra Shipp, and Hari Nef. Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) is the protagonist, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Barbie created by Ruth Handler. Her Ken counterpart, Ryan Gosling, is portrayed with humor and heart. They are a version of Eve and Adam, with their fall being dramatic. Barbie finds her perfect life hampered by existential thoughts and seeks answers from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), a doll with a traumatic history. Stereotypical Barbie, with Ken, heads to real-world Los Angeles to find her little girl. The relationship between Barbies and their human owners is tenuously outlined, so it's best not to think too deeply about how it all works. Robbie's performance in Gerwig's Barbie highlights the tension between Barbie as an object and subject. Her expressive eyes and physical presence reveal the human world's forces, while her rigid presence in Barbieland suggests she's not less rigid in the real world. Despite the director's skill in capturing deeper themes, the film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest it ultimately serves a brand. The film's ominousness and muddied politics suggest the film serves as a brand. Gerwig's film Barbieland is a mix of fun and emotional depth, with a tension between keeping Barbie entertaining and blending her source material with previous projects. After a detour, Barbie returns home to find Ken's patriarchal knowledge has transformed Barbieland. The screenplay, by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, avoids familiarity and mockery, but the moments that aren't just funny are buried in important monologues, making the gestures feel politically hollow.

It was would be like if Kanye West's ""Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy"" album was a movie. Cillian Murphy puts on a virtuoso performance encapsulating the deeply complicated and contradictory life that Oppenheimer lived. The pace that the movie runs at is so intense and the music is used perfectly to capture that. The explosion of the bomb is so realistically filmed that you feel fully immersed in Los Alamos. The subtle themes of ""The Fission"" and ""The""fusion"" floated at the beginning of the movie is an incredible way to depict to the two separate courtroom like battles Oppenheimer and Strauss are involved in. Nolan has many great movies under his belt but this movie tops them all.",Oppenheimer
4.0,BORING,fernandamdiaz,21 July 2023,"Too long, too much boring dialogue. There is more than an hour of film left. They forgot the primary objective of cinema, which is to entertain, and they got lost in cinematography, editing, sound, etc. How is it possible to make a movie about the father of the boring atomic bomb? The first hour and a half is so heavy. Unintelligible dialogues. Scientists sitting at the table boring us to infinity. The Florence Pugh part is so inconsequential. Luckily the last half hour with a brilliant Robert Downey Jr. The movie was better. Best: Robert Downey Jr. Worst: Overrated Everything. We need better stories.",Oppenheimer
10.0,What A Film! I Was Ecstatic About Seeing Barbie And It Definitely Exceeded My Expectations By Far.,rannynm,21 July 2023,"What a film! I was ecstatic about seeing Barbie and it definitely exceeded my expectations by far. As much as I was excited, I was a bit scared that the stakes were too high; after all Barbie is an icon and a part of so many people's childhood. For a film like this it's very easy to create something corny, disappointing, or unappealing to viewers. I'm so glad that Gretta Gerwig stepped up to the plate and created an absolute masterpiece.The film starts with showing the origin of Barbie in 1959. It explains how little girls used to play with baby dolls and commonly acted as their mothers, but wanted a doll that they could really play with instead of taking care of. And that's how Barbie came about. Then we see the beautiful Barbie world where every Barbie is a part of something. We see Barbie doctors, Barbie novelists, Barbie astronauts, Barbie everything! And in Barbie's world every day is perfect. The star of the show Margot Robbie plays ""Stereotypical Barbie"" and she starts to notice strange things happening to her. She has to visit the real world to see who was playing with her to discover why these strange things are happening. The rest of the film is about Barbie trying to find herself and discovering scary aspects of the real world that she was blinded by before.There was so much love put into this film and you can really see that on screen. The comedy in this film is so on point that the whole theater was laughing when I went to see this film. Huge kudos to Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach, writers of this incredible screenplay. The script is pure genius; I love how the film really honors Barbie and what she was made for. The cast of this film is exceptional. Margot Robbie was originally producing the film until she was cast as Barbie. Margot is the perfect Barbie; she plays this role so well she is like a real-life Barbie on screen. The way she embodies Barbie is just so perfect. I was really excited to see Ryan Gosling as Ken since he's one of my favorite actors. There's a lot of controversy as to why Ryan Gosling was cast as Ken but he makes perfect sense. He plays Ken so well he really nails what it means to be Ken in this film. America Ferrera plays a Mom named Gloria and she is such an interesting character. She plays a mom who's going through struggles of just being a woman and I'm sure her character will speak to so many mothers. It would be a crime to not talk about the insane set. Funny enough, Greta Gerwig used so much pink paint for this set that it actually drained an entire company's supply. The Barbie world is exactly as you'd expect it -- from Barbie dream-houses to Barbie beaches -- everything looks like it came right out of a toy store. Rodrigo Prieto shot this film and the cinematography is extraordinary. As someone who grew up with Barbie, this film really speaks to me. I am in love with the score of this film. Billie Eilish's ""What was I made for"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard. This film is packed with so many great artists like Tame Impalla, Lizzo, Dua Lipa and many others.The film is packed with so many messages. I was surprised with how many topics this film covers -- what it means to be a woman, what it means to be a mother, what it's like to grow up in today's society, what is love, and so much more. This film is a celebration of women and girlhood but I also love how it represents men. Ken is discovering how men are viewed in today's society in a similar way to how Barbie is discovering who she is.I give Barbie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults.

10.0,An awe-inspiring theatrical experience!,Anurag-Shetty,21 July 2023,"Oppenheimer is a biopic of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer(Cillian Murphy). Dr. Oppenheimer faces all kinds of hurdles, both internal & external, during his crucial role in developing the atomic bomb, during World War II.Oppenheimer is a mind-blowing film. Writer-director Christopher Nolan has given us another masterpiece, after Memento(2000), The Dark Knight Trilogy(2005-2012), The Prestige(2006), Inception(2010), Interstellar(2014), Dunkirk(2017) & Tenet(2020). This movie is a must watch in IMAX. You feel like you are right there with the soldiers & scientists, when they're testing the atomic bomb, during the Manhattan Project. Your seats start vibrating, the sound effects are earth-shattering & the visuals are crystal clear & ultra-realistic. This is because Nolan didn't use any CGI to recreate the nuclear explosions seen in the film. This is absolutely phenomenal! The cinematography by Hoyte van Hoytema is breathtaking. The background score by Ludwig Goransson is epic. You will be on the edge of your seat, throughout. Cillian Murphy is the star of the show, as J. Robert Oppenheimer. Murphy expertly portrays the rollercoaster of emotions both subtle & not so subtle, that his character goes through during the course of the movie. Cillian Murphy's spectacular performance as the titular character, is the highlight of the film. Robert Downey Jr is outstanding as Lewis Strauss. Emily Blunt is phenomenal as Kitty Oppenheimer. Matt Damon is fantastic as Leslie Groves. Florence Pugh is amazing as Jean Tatlock. The supporting cast is brilliant. Oppenheimer is a must watch(especially in IMAX) for Christopher Nolan fans, Cillian Murphy fans & pretty much everyone else. It deserves all the Oscars at next year's Academy Awards. We will be discussing the impact of this movie, for years to come!",Oppenheimer
10.0,It's not what I expected but in a good way,juodvilte,21 July 2023,"The movie in my opinion is great, it's no Godfather but it's a movie about BARBIE it's supposed to be fun, easy going and delightful but also amazingly brings up the problems of todays women and MEN. It has a great portrayal of the difference between the barbie world and the real human world. The characters are weirdly relatable and understandable. Margot Robbie was the best pick for barbie and Ryan as Ken ( even tho some may disagree, but no just watch the movie he is perfect) it's really funny but also in some scenes very sad and relatable. I recommend watching this movie because of : 1. Humour the ending really caught me off guard ngl 😂 2. The movie not being dragged out and hard to watch 3. Interesting storyline even tho there are still those smarts that think it's basic. It's not. It made me realise some sadder things about characters like Ken and think about the human world 4. Message you gotta watch the movie for this one 😏 5. Great acting, dancing and yesss even singing its a bit basic and cheesy to put this to the list but I find it really impressive on how natural a human can act like a barbie.6. Great props makes you feel like they're actually in a plastic house.",Barbie

9.0,Murphy is exceptional,Orlando_Gardner,19 July 2023,"You'll have to have your wits about you and your brain fully switched on watching Oppenheimer as it could easily get away from a nonattentive viewer. This is intelligent filmmaking which shows it's audience great respect. It fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace and jumps to very different times in Oppenheimer's life continuously through it's 3 hour runtime. There are visual clues to guide the viewer through these times but again you'll have to get to grips with these quite quickly. This relentlessness helps to express the urgency with which the US attacked it's chase for the atomic bomb before Germany could do the same. An absolute career best performance from (the consistenly brilliant) Cillian Murphy anchors the film. This is a nailed on Oscar performance. In fact the whole cast are fantastic (apart maybe for the sometimes overwrought Emily Blunt performance). RDJ is also particularly brilliant in a return to proper acting after his decade or so of calling it in. The screenplay is dense and layered (I'd say it was a thick as a Bible), cinematography is quite stark and spare for the most part but imbued with rich, lucious colour in moments (especially scenes with Florence Pugh), the score is beautiful at times but mostly anxious and oppressive, adding to the relentless pacing. The 3 hour runtime flies by. All in all I found it an intense, taxing but highly rewarding watch. This is film making at it finest. A really great watch.",Oppenheimer

4.0,Like an Endless Trailer,crimeagainstcreation,25 July 2023,"The character assassination of Julius Robert Oppenheimer is a much described and debated subject, and it's basically also what this film is about, I think, and little about nuclear bomb making. Nevertheless, though it's nearly three hours long, director Christopher Nolan still tries to fill the plot with more than is possible, and the results is that it stylistically appears like an endless trailer, where the editing and the jumping in time looks more like a long music video than an epic film. At times it becomes distressing to watch, and it's a great relief when this cannonade of pictures takes breaks in a few longer and slower sequences. If the intention has been to illustrate the main character's inner life during the process, it's perhaps reasonable, but this great topic would probably fit better as a mini series. However, Cillian Murphy makes the very best out of it as Oppenheimer, and despite the aggressive editing he manages to build a credible character. Sadly it doesn't work too well for several other characters, who also are more or less miscasted.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Fun movie,vanwierreinder,24 July 2023,I liked the movie and really enjoyed myself watching it. I did think the feminism was a little too 'on the nose' sometimes. But it's difficult to make a film that caters to all audiences. Overall it was a job well done. The set was beautiful and everything expected from a Barbie movie. Simu Liu and Ryan Gosling were showstealers as rivalling Kens and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast. I was also really surprised that the slogan 'a movie for people who love Barbie and people who hate Barbie' caught the essence. They didn't shy away addressing the controversies surrounding some of the Barbie dolls and Mattel as a company.,Barbie

10.0,An ode to film and actors,druganbogdan,23 July 2023,"Incredible, riveting an ode to film making, to story telling.Please go to see it on the big screen!!Nolan can make Matt Damon to act, Rober Downy JR to suck the life from the theater and Florence Pugh, don't make me start about Florence.Nolan is one of the last creators, With the advent of AI, maybe this is the last ""FILM"" to be ever made!It is more like a theater. The Trinity event is impresive, but the last scene in the commission room is the main event of the film, Nolan can put the entire History of the World in one small chamber, in a bureaucratic procedure.Thank you Mister Regizor fot this regal for the mind and soul!",Oppenheimer
8.0,Not the Bomb; Good Entertainment,Jephy1,25 July 2023,"This is a slow-burn grown-up movie that doesn't rely on CGI, swooshes and/or thuds to make us think we're watching something good. The science seems to be lacking (Oppie was a scientist), but this is a biography, not a Manhattan project development tale (read Rhodes' ""The Making of the Atomic Bomb"" for that). And given this, so is missing a thorough character development of the protagonist. In the end, we know he succeeded yet cannot pinpoint just how that happened: we know that Groves, aptly played by Damon, was outrageously difficult for a scientist to deal with. The IMAX format was not necessary as the visuals/sets don't get a boost from it. It just has no grand visual elements. But the story and subject matter held my attention. Blunder: I was sorry to (not) see a proper epilogue noting the very recent posthumous reinstatement of Oppenheimer's security clearance. Costuming was poor: 1940s men always wore hats and shirts that were (only) white. Aside from hairstyles (and period autos) the piece felt too modern. Truman's Whitehouse was quite authentic. But it does what a flick is supposed to do: entertain! 8/10.",Oppenheimer
3.0,Don't believe the hype,vtcfzhfy,24 July 2023,"Aside from the sound design which was good, nothing here was really revolutionary. The mere length and drawn out dialogue made this film a snooze fest; the last time I wanted to leave the theater or just close my eyes was at the showing of the latest Matrix.Additionally, complex details of insignificance and multiple characters/ name dropping make it hard to follow for the average viewer unless you are already well versed on the backstory.Lastly, many scenes, in particular of the non-PG variety could have been cut out as they did not add to the story and wasted time.I would not suggest going out of your way to see this film. With 3 hours of a viewer's attention, you should walk away with something.",Oppenheimer
3.0,"Hardly any laughter in my theater, though perhaps the film wasn't meant to entertain",SureCommaNot,25 July 2023,"In one sense, this film was more inevitable than Thanos. What do you get when you're part of a society that fuels existential crises, by constantly eroding definitions and structures? Barbie and Ken aren't exactly human (they don't even have genitals); they're embodied ideas, and so they face this amorphous crisis of identity that pits their presuppositional views of a happy society against that of the ""real world."" But their perception of the real world is like seeing a plane for the first time and therefore thinking it's a dragon. So how much can an audience glean from the pontifications of characters who are essentially children? I would have greatly preferred scriptwriters more well-versed in sociology as well as comedy, writers who understand not only American ideals, and how those ideals have shifted, but the role that Barbie has played along the way. I get the sense that the writers here just KNOW Barbie had some impact, without really understanding much beyond that. There was so much to explore, and it could have been shown situationally, rather than through heavy-handed exposition.Off-screen, apparently Ken had some interesting realizations about his misunderstandings of patriarchy, and Barbie had some realizations about how she treated Ken, but we don't get to see any of this nuance actually played out. Hugely missed opportunities there.Bottom line: As fantastic as Robbie and Gosling were, I wish this movie just didn't exist. Keep the cast, but try again with a much better script and director.",Barbie
10.0,"Fab and Fun, Kenough",ariannakerber,21 July 2023,"This was a great movie for the type that it is. Yes, is cheeky / cheesy/ over the top. It's also heart warming, fun, and really original. I loved the way that the movie hit the nail on the head about the complexity of being female, young or old. It truly was a reflection of how so many of us have been made to feel. They also got some laughs over play on words or specific movements made by the actors and actresses because it was just so real and true to the way we all played as children. The casting of MR as Barbie and RG as Ken were such perfect choices. The kids liked it and so did us 30 somethings. Perfect balance of nostalgia and today. Highly recommend it.",Barbie
8.0,Barbie has an existential crisis,No-Life-101,22 July 2023,"Barbie is a really fun movie that all ages can enjoy because while it's colourful and entertaining the main storyline can get emotional at times. The comedy in the movie is pretty funny too and got a few laughs from everyone in the cinema, the music is really nice and so are the choreographed dances. What I liked the most about this movie is that it was very doll-like, the food and drink were plastic and fake, the cars didn't have engines and just glided along the floor, and the actors were doll-like in their movements and how they interacted with their environment.The sheer amount of details that are in this movie is amazing, from the clothes, the wide variety of dolls, cars, pets, houses, and even down to the accessories were a perfect match to what's being sold or what has been sold in the past. On another note, I was not expecting the plot twist and the antagonist to be revealed, but that's what I liked about this movie, I went in thinking to know what this movie was going to be about but I was wrong and was surprised. As the movie progresses you find yourself enjoying it more and more, it's well paced and it has a good story so I definitely recommend it!",Barbie
5.0,Disappointing,kirbyirish-78535,22 July 2023,"Had so much more potential. This script was disastrous and felt like what you see in a disappointing sequel. Although Margot Robbie is a perfect cast and she does her job well, it's not enough to carry this movie alone. Ryan Gosling was the bright positive and main source of entertainment, especially during the first half of the film. Not the worst movie of the year but not the best of it's release week either.Overall feeling is Gerwig tried a little too hard with the story and ended up missing the point. I am still left with questions of objectives by certain story arcs. Ultimately they tried to be a little too deep, muddying the water and losing the crowd along the way.",Barbie
9.0,Pure Escapist Fun,anchitbaishya2004,23 July 2023,"Barbie directed by Greta Gerwig introduces us to Stereotypical Barbie played by Margot Robbie having yet another perfect day in Barbieland an utopia where all its inhabitants are dolls, living in their pink dreamhouses with no exterior walls. Each day in Barbieland is a perfect day. However one day Barbie shows signs of being a human and is asked to go to Barbieland to figure out who's playing with her and fix everything. Along the way she discovers the joys and perils of living amongst humans and where she's truly meant to be.In this day and age when a lot of the movies rely on being ultra realistic and dark Barbie comes off as a surprise. It's escapism from reality and lots of entertainment is what audiences are craving right now. Barbie is such a fun and gorgeous movie that is filled with humour, heart, emotions and a lot of good messages. The production design and costumes are fantastic to look at and are absolute eye candies. The story is about self discovery and the evaluation of life however some might be caught off guard with the risks that Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach take with thier storytelling and social commentary.Speaking of the performances, Margot Robbie is perfect as Stereotypical Barbie but its Ryan Gosling's Ken that shines the most. He provides most of the comedic relief and is absolutely hilarious. The rest of cast does a pretty good job. Plus the monologue given by America Ferrera is something that everybody should listen to. It's so touching and talks about the challenges a woman has to go through in the society.Overall Barbie is a vibrant, bold and delightful movie that is fuelled by its star studded cast and flawlessly incorporated humour and though some of the creative choices might not always stick the landing, the good stuff largely overpowers the bad ones to create an immersive experience for the audience. Greta Gerwig has done it yet again.",Barbie
9.0,Barbie!!!,jonesjackson-23987,22 July 2023,"There was a lot of hype leading up to this movie, because of the cast and simply because it's a movie about Barbie. This movie 100% backed up it's hype. This was a very funny movie with a great storyline. I am going to be honest, I was not expecting it to be that good of a storyline and it truly was.It was a weirdly funny movie that also had good morals and a great message behind it. Ryan Gosling stole the show and cracked up the audience basically every-time he appeared on the screen (along with Will Ferrell of course) Margot Robbie did a phenomenal job as Barbie. Overall it was an amazing watch and no reason this movie should receive any hate!",Barbie
1.0,Do not waste your time!,NFDragon,23 July 2023,"I don't know what compelled me to watch this movie in theatre IMAX. They truly spend a lot on marketing, and it worked. I was one of those who thought Tenet was one of the worst movies ever made, but I gave Nolan the benefit of the doubt because of Interstellar. Lo and behold, he went right ahead and made another long and pointless movie about nothing.This movie was SO BORING. The only thing that stopped people from sleeping in the theatre was the upbeat soundtrack throughout the whole movie (Literally upbeat music was playing from start to finish over a very boring storyline and dialogue).I'm writing this review after coming back home on a Saturday afternoon, hoping it stops someone from making the same mistake I made. Avoid it like cancer. Not because of saving your money, but to save your precious time. Don't even watch it at home.I went in the theatre, and I came out without gaining anything. In fact, some part of me died in there because of the absolute waste of talent in that picture. I don't know what it was, but it certainly wasn't what cinema ought to be.Nolan, you fooled me twice! I hope you quit and spare people from your future ""movies"".",Oppenheimer
5.0,Could have been feministic in a good way,sarahsoderstrom,19 July 2023,"With all the hype around this film, my expectations were high and were initially met. The film begins as a self-aware, lighthearted critique of its own legacy but, as Barbie steps her flattened foot into the real world, transcends into a clumsy story on gender inequalities. Whilst funny and original at first, it doesn't take long to notice the repetition of the same jokes that were introduced in the initial minutes of the script, as the film transitions into a full-blown battle of the sexes. Despite these flaws, the casting is well-executed, with Ryan Gosling delivering a brilliant performance as Ken. Unfortunately, even his portrayal is unable to compensate for the deficient plot.",Barbie
6.0,Critic Review,paumilme,23 July 2023,"As usual Nolan had directed this movie in multiple timelines and also using black and white effect. Story of scientist said by sound effects. I heard in marketing event Nolan boasting about no VFX but only to makeup with the sound effects.Definitely not that great as inception and interstellar. Murphy, daemon, Robert were amazing and really blended well into their roles. If you compare with Chernobyl it's not that great. Gravity is not kept throughout the movie and it's tried to hype with bringing names of very renowned scientists! Could have been directed in better way considering the star cast of movie..",Oppenheimer
8.0,Life in Plastic It's Fantastic,rexmatthewj,21 July 2023,"Barbie (2023) is a fantasy comedy film directed by Greta Gerwig and co-written by her and Noah Baumbach, based on the iconic fashion dolls by Mattel. The film stars Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, who go on a journey of self-discovery after their expulsion from Barbieland, a matriarchal society where all women are successful and independent. Along the way, they encounter various challenges and surprises in the real world, a multifaceted exploration of existentialism, consumerism, and femininity.Barbie 2023 is a delightful and refreshing film that celebrates Barbie as a cultural icon and a role model for girls and women of all ages. It is incredibly funny and smart, with a terrific ensemble cast that all go for it in the best ways. It is also a clever and creative film that explores various themes and issues that are relevant and relatable to today's society.

9.0,"Christopher Nolan, ladies and gentlemen!",El-Ak,21 July 2023,"I had the privilege to watch it yesterday in an IMax theater and it was a wholesome experience. This movie ranks for me among Nolan's top 3 films and there is nothing anyone could do to change my mind. Nolan jumped in a completely new genre other than the adventure, action and sci fi genre and he outdid most of the biography films I have seen. I also hardly watch any political films and surprisingly the movie could grab my attention that much. From the very first scene till the last the cinematography and the great Ludwig Göransson's score will take your breath away and I think the oscar for best cinematography and score has already been decided. Ludwig's score in this film overtakes some of Hanz Zimmer's top scores that I admire. The VFX is no doubt so well made as well and you already know that he didn't use a single CGI shot. The movie resembles Cillian Murphy's top lifetime performance and I doubt anyone could have done Oppenheimer better than him and I doubt anyone could top his performance this year and it would be a complete robbery If he didn't get the oscar this year. More importantly, this movie represents a savior for RDJ's career. The first half his time on the screen wasn't much enough and I started to doubt that he would be great at all, however, the second half of the film was ompletely driven by him. He will take your breath away with one of his all-time best performance and I doubt that he would!t get at least an oscar nom for this. Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh's time on the screen wasn't much and I actually didn't like Florence's character at all. Emily did a couple of great scenes within the time allowed for her, but still I actually felt this character a bit weird and her relationship and actions with Oppenheimer wasn't clear enough for me. The editing of this film was also one of the heros got all these elements together and of course all of that wouldn't haven been possible without the great mr. Christopher Nolan. He easily can transform any element and any actor to the best form he could ever imagine of himself. All in all, it's a cinematic meal that you wouldn't wanna miss and the I-Max experience was one of a kind. A solid 9/10 and one of Nolan's all time top films.",Oppenheimer

7.0,"It is, indeed, a Barbie world",cliftonofun,23 July 2023,"Granted, my experience of Barbie may have been influenced by the fact that I saw it an hour after getting out of Oppenheimer, but I gotta say: I thoroughly enjoyed watching this one in a crowded theater on opening weekend. The degree of difficulty here cannot be overstated. Just making a decent movie about Barbie is tough. Making one that is hilarious and insightful and at points actually touching? That should be impossible, but Gerwig nails it in many ways. Not everything worked for me, but not everything works for me in any comedy. Overall, they told a story about a toy which I have no attachment to (and at points would have described as problematic), and totally sucked me in. And based on the theater's reaction around me, I wasn't alone.",Barbie
10.0,One of Nolan's best,nathanmullen-80524,24 July 2023,"Everything in this movie is amazing. The acting is near perfection with Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Matt Damon and countless others. Cillian Murphy's performance in particular is sure to be Oscar winning with how he portrays Robert Oppenheimer so well. The writing of this film will keep you wanting more and more out of this film. Even if you are a Marvel fan were you want to see constant action you will still be on your seat at each moment. The music only adds to this only much more with the music being on par with Interstellar. You will be watching this movie and be completely sub directed of the film by each quaking moment. I can't think of a dull moment in this film. This is easily one of Cristopher Nolan's best movies with it easily reaching his top three and debatably reaching top two. You can feel the atomic bomb detonation and with every sound you can feel and almost feel like you're there. The cinematography also has to be mentioned where you cannot deny at how good it is. You will be leaving the theater jaws dropped at the ending. And I must mention that you will not feel the runtime at all. The first two hours go by so fast you will want to do it over and over again and the last hour you just wish it to be longer and forever.",Oppenheimer
7.0,"A little overly ambitious, but still a good film",mcdonaldparis-83809,21 July 2023,"The pacing will take you aback at first; Oppenheimer meets and divorces his wife within 5 minutes, but it's the price to pay to set the context for the two big moments later in the film.Understandably, it's hard to tell someone's entire life story in 3hrs while also creating enough drama to keep an audience hooked. Nolan chose to tell two stories, which is definitely engaging, but it ends up feeling like there's a first act, but then 2 3rd acts.There's also more ambitious filmmaking, but it comes off as a little self indulgent, especially with 2 awkward sex scenes posing as ""art"".With that said though, Nolan knows how to keep you engaged. There's a literal minute long countdown and I could feel my heart building with each second. Even after 2hrs, I still refused to allow my attention to slip thanks to the engaging cutting between scenes in multiple points in Oppenheimers life and building to a second crescendo.Last weird technical thing to note: the camera loses focus a lot, especially in the last hour. Clearly they were running at a low aperture on a medium format camera, but that meant even the slightest deviation on the focus was noticeable. I saw tons of shots where someone's ear or nose was in focus but not their eyes, because with such high ape rather you can't be off by a single cm.Definitly check out the film though, and obviously in IMAX if you can since I saw it in standard cinema and felt like I was missing out on something better.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Barbie comes to life,housermichael,21 July 2023,"I am a big fan of the actress Margot Robbie. I loved her last year in ""Babylon"" and ""Amsterdam"". And before those I loved her in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and as Harley Quinn in ""Suicide Squad"", ""Birds of Prey"" and ""The Suicide Squad"".I also liked Ryan Gosling in ""La la land"".Now here they are together in ""Barbie"" directed by Greta Gerwig, who did such a great job with ""Little Women"" and ""Lady Bird"".I didn't know what to expect from a movie about a Barbie doll but this movie is a very entertaining and fun movie that brings Barbie's world to life with great production design and costumes and good cinematography.I couldn't imagine another actress playing this part as perfectly as Margot Robbie does here. She is a great movie star. The supporting cast is also excellent including Will Ferrell as the CEO of Mattel. I had a great time with the movie ""Barbie"".",Barbie
10.0,Exceptional film,harrisz-27099,23 July 2023,"The movie had beautiful shots throughout the movie as well as mini storylines that kept you well entertained Even up to the three hour mark. With all the movie shorter than ever It is good to see a film that can entertain people for hours on end. The storyline that was presented in this movie was incredible and well worth every second. The soundtrack was breathtaking and amazing to see in theaters. The storytelling aspect of the movie was able to capture you the entire way. The bomb seen was beautifully done and away, not seen before in explosions. I truly great film that explores the history of the atomic bomb.",Oppenheimer
7.0,Barbie Movie does give an Identity to Barbie of GenZ,maggicmanch,22 July 2023,"""I want to do the imagining. I don't want to be the idea."".When my kid informed me he and his friends were going to see a Barbie movie, I couldn't believe it. The stereotypical mother in me instantly responded. Seeing as how MI and IJ were running in parallel in theatres, I was taken aback and asked him why a group of boys would be interested in seeing Barbie. Will there be any girls there? I'm guessing I probably sounded kind of dorky in his ears. His response, though, was typical of his generation:This is a spoof and not a movie aimed at just girls, Mom. But, like any mother, I made arrangements to watch the movie myself before he did. Also, the other reason was that as a kid, I had eight dolls, and the majority of my time went into playing with them and building stories. And only Barbie was one of those dolls whose identity was recognised consistently over the globe. Barbie therefore represents the shared imagination of all kids who play with it across the world.It was the right decision to see this film because otherwise I would not have realised what a brilliant move it was for the brand to reach out to younger consumers. Barbie is a great gimmick for a rebranding campaign to appeal to Generation Z, which places an emphasis on pragmatics.We all know that Barbie has a checkered history. Barbie's version as a math-averse doll was not received well. Barbie, packaged with a ""don't eat"" diet handbook, protested. Someone who seems black on the exterior but is really white on the inside was being mocked by Oreao's crazy cookie Barbie. The creepiest thing was pregnant Barbie with babies in her belly, and the oddest thing was when Barbie went through puberty. Hijab Barbie and Virus Barbie both sparked new debates. Parents were largely concerned about the FBI tip of a security threat regarding the Video Girl Barbie.Most criticised among Gen Z was Barbie's excessively slender body, which has been an undesirable role model for women. It precisely articulates the enormous problem of existential crises that the outside world has manufactured and which individuals have mindlessly embraced.To begin with, the film explored the same themes, including the existential difficulties brought on by the persistence of patriarchy and Barbie stereotypes. The story starts with Barbie living a happy life in Barbieland, but she notices that she is developing human consciousness. To find answers, she has to travel to the real world in order to restore normality. As she and Ken enter the real world, Barbie is overwhelmed to see the many ways in which women are treated as objects and devalued. Multiple sets of eyes scrutinise all of their actions. Both Barbie and Ken's masculine awakenings also go through existential crises. Later in the movie, with Ken's changed behaviour after going to the real world, Barbie's attempt to appease Ken's manly ego by playing a weakling is satire. However, the much-touted ""gender war"" is seen humorously despite the fact that it still exists, whether people accept it or not.Now, coming to the technical part of the film, the Barbie-land segment was overdone. The transition from Barbie Land to the actual world was also too long; a crisp cut here, as in Jumanji, would have made more sense. So the movie has a sluggish start, but it picks up speed and becomes engaging as time goes on. The humour was really cliched and cheap, so that wasn't great.Both Margot's and Ryan's performances were excellent. While the actors were all spot-on, the film's direction let it down by not keeping the action moving at a good clip and by delivering a confusing muddle of a plot and a message that left viewers with no clear conclusions. A more succinct conclusion would have been fantastic. Though I did like the part at the end where, at the workplace, Barbie prefers Flat Sandals over heels, I was relating all this to my pageant life, where wearing a minimum of 3.5 inches of heels was mandatory before stepping out of your room in public. In the movie, Barbie leaves the fake world behind.To end with my favourite line by Barbie's creator, Ruth Handler, played by Rhea Perlman: ""Humans have only one ending. Ideas live for ever."" The movie is a good introduction to the world of dolls for those who haven't seen anything like it before. It is a case study in itself, showing how the power of sentiment is a driving force in the doll industry. After a year of record sales during the epidemic, last year saw a dip, so it's easy to see why Mattel is counting on the new Barbie film to reverse the trend by syncing up with generation Z's pragmatic thinking.",Barbie
6.0,Good jokes and a disappointing Ending,adibshahriar,23 July 2023,At the interval I was surprised of how much I was enjoying Barbie with its amazing humour which was super ironic and subtle commentary on male patriarchy and consumerism. The overall theme of the movie was also quite good reflecting many aspects of human life and how it becomes more critical with age. But it was so disappointing in the third act which takes away the brilliant build up. Ryan Gosling showed his ranged and made me laugh so many times. Margot Robbie shined brilliantly just like she does during the whole film. But I expected more from Barbie and Greta Gerwig didn't satisfy me. She should have tried for a different sort of ending.,Barbie
3.0,Not family friendly or really enjoyable,ayanks,22 July 2023,"I expected this movie to be more lighthearted and it had heavy themes and material. The first half hour or so was ok and had some funny moments but the second half just wasn't enjoyable to me. The writing was not good story telling and felt more like a number of speeches. I found it hard to watch honestly.There was a lot of overt messaging that I feel was not suitable for this movie. I didn't appreciate the depiction of the relationship between Ken and Barbie or the situation created for them. The acting, some musical numbers and sets were good but overall a missed opportunity to make a fun feel-good movie. I was very disappointed.",Barbie
9.0,Fun and insightful,tabletopcouchpotato,21 July 2023,"I am a big fan of Greta Gerwig but not a Barbie fan. I got excited by all the promo but didn't know what to expectThe movie exceeded my expectations so much. It was fun and absurdist but also profound.The depth in the movie is the perfect level - it doesn't go too far and still feels fun and playful but still does deep explorations. It's also just really funny and clever and campy in the best way.I loved the costuming, the set design, the cinematography and the acting. I was skeptical about Ryan Gosling as Ken but his performance was so good! Margot Robbie was perfect as well. This movie was so fun and so creative and interesting.",Barbie
8.0,"Hi, Barbie!",bunlandest,23 July 2023,""" Barbie "", fulfilling the expectations of our childhood dreams.This is the first live-action Barbie movie adaptation based on Mattel's Barbie fashion doll. Margot Robbie as Barbie and Ryan Gosling as Ken, who go on a journey of self-discovery following an existential crisis.Shimmery pink in the dream world while Barbie and her friends placed lovingly. Barbie Land features detailed replicas at a specific scale to look like life-size toy dolls. The clothes, furnitures, dream house, and background of the movie set are all designed to look like the original toy. Barbie Land's construction almost entirely uses an enchanting pink colour.Greta Gerwig as a director neatly wraps up the complex issues faced by women in society in a fun and easily accessible way.Barbie itself is a representation of all women's hopes and desires to be anything they want, including the right to live free from violence and discrimination, to be educated, to own property, and to vote. In Barbie Land, women rule the worlds.Barbie's casting choices have a specific quality. Barbie's Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling obviously looks perfect. Margot Robbie is a living doll, her face and posture are perfect to play the role of Barbie. Although, Ryan Gosling steals the whole show. Ken looks fun to hang out with.The entire soundtrack of the Barbie movie is very meaningful and upbeat.",Barbie
9.0,A Technicolor Dream,heatherhilgers,24 July 2023,"Wow, this movie was a love letter to cinema. From the Kubrick reference at the opening, to the soundstage being 100% real - no cgi for the sets. There were dance sequences like in the olden days (think Grease) and the costuming , wow the costuming. Greta Gerwig dug deep to make this masterpiece using all of her technical chops along the way. The casting director also nailed it, everyone was wonderful.The acting was perfection, I loved seeing the variety of Barbie's on screen and there were so many jokes that would be appropriate for all audiences, this has to be a voluntary PG13 rating as there wasn't swearing or nudity. There was one beach fight amongst the Kens but that's not really violence compared to today's average films, no one was harmed nor any fake blood used.I actually didn't like the ending at all, and I was quite annoyed that Rhea Perlman played the creator of Barbie but made two quips about the IRS getting her for tax evasion - something Ruth Handler never dealt with. Her problem was with the SEC after she had signed off on a positive Mattel earnings forecast when they knew they were in a down quarter - how's that so tough to explain?Irregardless, I want to see this movie again. And again. And again.",Barbie
10.0,Nolan's Greatest work of all time,dhruvpataudi,25 July 2023,"I literally have no words to describe the movie.It was so enigmatic and exciting, I wasn't even able to take my eyes off the screen.Every single second of the movie had me invested.Robert Downey Jr played an amazing role, I would say this character is one of the greatest characters Robert has played in any movie.I have no words for Cillian, he was just outstanding. The portrayal, the acting, the emotions, everything was 10/10.Every single character portrayal was beyond excellent, whether it be Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Rami Malek....the list would not end, every single character was so good.I would say it's a must watch movie.Christopher Nolan never disappoints as always...",Oppenheimer

Yes, I was fully expecting a message, but not one that would be hammered onto our heads.Zero subtlety and a deficiency of real wit.There was a moment in the film that held promise, re: Ken and the subject of masculinity, but it was squandered.This film is very fortunate for the Barbenheimer phenomenon, because I'm not sure word of mouth could have served it as well.I love me a chick flick - just not this one.",Barbie
8.0,It's really something different and that's a good thing,threenails10,20 July 2023,"It's really something different but some of it feels inspired by other films, I caught references to Fight Club, 2001 Space Odyssey, Lego Movie, and others I can't think of at the moment. But yeah, this was a special film. I don't think as many people will like it as it probably deserves. But I did love most of it. Sometimes the tones felt off at times but it's definitely recommended to see. The satire works great here and the production design, cinematography and acting (intentionally bad in a way on purpose in some spots to deliver the satire aspects) are all perfectly done here though overall. The music is a highlight here too which is sometimes hilarious and reminded me of the Lego movie in some ways. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are both pitch perfect here as well. Definitely recommend anyone to give it a chance. I wouldn't say this is a family movie but I think families with older kids would work perfectly for this. Not sure this will be in the Oscar race but it seems like it will at least for technical aspects and production designs.",Barbie
2.0,At least Ryan Gosling was there to save it,palchiica,24 July 2023,"Right of the bat I should say that I only got interested in this movie because it featured Ryan Gosling - and honestly, if it wasn't for him, the movie wouldn't even get one star from me.The movie theater was filled with little girls, while I think this isn't really something a kid should be watching.It wasn't inspiring at all for me, nor did it make me emotional. The point wasn't really well made, in fact it mostly ended up being corny and worn-out. I really found it hard to sit through the whole movie, especially the ending scenes, I just wanted it to finally be over. Wasn't really worth all the hype and the money spent.",Barbie
10.0,Cinematic Masterpiece,natejohn17,25 July 2023,"The film's narrative structure exhibits a seamless blend of historical accuracy and artistic interpretation, captivating audiences with its gripping storyline and compelling character portrayals. Through meticulous attention to detail, the production team brings to life the era's ambiance, immersing viewers in the 1940s scientific and political landscape.With awe-inspiring cinematography and an evocative musical score, the movie succeeds in heightening emotions and adding depth to pivotal moments of Oppenheimer's life. The depiction of the Manhattan Project's challenges and ethical implications is thought-provoking, leaving the audience with a profound sense of contemplation.The supporting cast delivers exceptional performances, complementing the lead's portrayal of Oppenheimer. Their chemistry adds layers of authenticity to the film, evoking empathy and understanding of the human elements in this crucial period of history.As the story unfolds, ""Oppenheimer"" also offers subtle insights into the broader sociopolitical context of the time, reflecting on the consequences of scientific innovation and the far-reaching impact of nuclear technology. This profound exploration makes the film not just a biographical drama but also a poignant commentary on humanity's capacity for both ingenuity and destruction.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic tour de force that masterfully captures the essence of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life and the ethical conundrums he faced. With its stellar performances, breathtaking visuals, and intellectual depth, the film resonates deeply, leaving a lasting impression on audiences. This thought-provoking portrayal of a brilliant but conflicted mind cements ""Oppenheimer"" as a cinematic gem and a must-watch for history enthusiasts and film aficionados alike.",Oppenheimer
3.0,A pointless movie,philipvalchev,24 July 2023,"For me this is the most pointless movie I've ever watched. I really don't understand where all this hype came from. My expectations were not that high considering the type of movie, but sill I waa not prepared for this -> which is the reason why I leave my first review in IMDB.For me this movie is just milking the Barbie brand. Great cast though! The sets, the costumes, the colours - these was perfect. And the actors play so well that you actually cringe while watching :)So, should you watch it?Haha no.

7.0,Big mix of testosterone and oestrogen,thaomytran-21068,19 July 2023,"Barbie movie was alright. Some scenes were quite cringe and the movie was not that super funny after all. Jokes here and there were sexually but that was it. Nowadays, I believe it is a good thing that the characters in the movie are all people from color. What is still a mystery and confusing is how they left the Barbieworld to the real world and vice versa... Besides the storyline was sometimes random and out of the blue how things turned out. I wouldn't definitely watch this movie again. Though, I would watch it as a drinking game, whenever someone says Barbie you have to take a shot. Cuz damn that word is being said sooo many times!",Barbie
3.0,The wrong genre for Nolan's cinematic storytelling,curtisherenow,25 July 2023,"The movie was too long and there were too many characters introduced. Also, the story was not told in a linear fashion, so you didn't always know what was happening. The last third and parts of the first third of the film were not really necessary. I had expected more.Acting was also rather poor, because the backgrounds of the other characters were not told, because everything was focused only on the main character Oppenheimer. So it was an impressive ensemble of actors, but all actors remained very pale in their roles. The supporting characters could have just as easily been cast by no-name actors. Cillian Murphy in the leading role was good, but not Oscar worthy.The camera wasn't good either, as there was too much focus on close-ups and too few white-angle shots.I didn't like the picture either. It was too dark and colors were barely shown.The best thing about the film was the soundtrack. It was very well nuanced and in tune with the film.In general, it can be said that biopics are not Nolan's genre. Spielberg (Schindler's List) and Scorsese (Aviator) can do that worlds better. Moreover, there are already excellent documentaries and books on the Manhattan Project.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Simply Stunning,morganflickinger,22 July 2023,"I have never written a review on this site, nor had I planned to until I sat down and watched Oppenheimer. I was floored by its effortless genius and masterful writing. The movie takes the viewer on a turbulent, frankly disturbing ride, that leaves you jostled, depressed, and stunned. A cinematic experience that goes unmatched. A cinematic experience that I hope is not overlooked by the often ignorant Oscars. The film easily cements itself as Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus. The directors usual tricks that often make his films at times fall flat, work wonders here. From the entirely practical effects to dialogue overload that in his other films feel hollow only fuel the fire that is Oppenheimer. Techniques that make me overjoyed that Nolan was the director to make this movie and not someone else. If you have not seen it, I urge you. Yes, it is long, and yes, it is not an action filled blockbuster, but it is something better. A movie that tells a story that changes the way the viewer perceives the world we live in. Because isn't that what art is supposed to do.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Greta Gerwig Makes A Perfect Movie,karim_zarrouk,21 July 2023,"I went into Wednesday expecting to write things like ""the greatest weekend in cinema"", ""Oppenheimer brings cinema to the screen again"", ""Barbie wins the weekend""... But this is so much more than that.Barbie was perfect. It shows something that I was able to experience for the first time in my life: the artistic pleasure of movies as a communal and cultural experience. Although watching Titanic was one of the greatest communal experiences of my life, it's the immediate cultural relevance of Barbie that makes it a first for me. It's the best that movies can be. And above all else, in six years time this might be looked back upon as one of the best movies of the decade.In the consumerist world's perfect fantasy sold to little girls as a toy-the polished plastic world of Barbie-everything is perfect. Starting with Barbie herself. Until the doll experiences something all too common to the real world but inexplicably strange to hers: an inexplicable desire to die. We get acquainted with the situation following a musical set-piece opening of the kind that tells you you're in for a great ride! (A pleasure made double for any Dua Lipa fan!)As it turns out, someone in the real world (Gloria (America Ferrera) a woman working an office job at Mattel) has communicated these emotions to her. It's now up to Barbie to travel to the real world to repair the rift in the space-time continuum. Her typical but good guy boyfriend Ken joins in for the ride.In the sweet and softhearted comedy that follows, Ken and Barbie make their first encounter with the real world, where Barbie finds out she's only ever sexualized, and Ken is treated with a newly discovered respect that he never knew in the Barbie world. Gradually, he discovers the patriarchy. When Barbie finally meets Gloria and her teenage daughter (beautifully cast and great showing from young Ariana Greenblatt) after they help her escape a chase with the corporate goons at Mattel that preside upon the cubical empire, the journey is done and they happily return to Barbieland. Only there's one problem: Ken has brought the patriarchy back home!With the visual representations of masculinity in popular culture (pretty much Rocky Balboa), outrageous rocker outfits, and a great fancy of horses (I share this with Ken I have to say), Ken has now amassed all the aesthetics he needs to firmly establish the rule of the patriarchy in Barbieland. The comedy is bafflingly funny, and the subject is urgently topical.I've lately had the feeling that movies today weren't as important as they used to, that they didn't mean as much and like Quentin Tarantino said and I agree, ""they're not in the zeitgeist (the spirit of the age)."" This movie was right in the zeitgeist!It's thanks to a collaboration between Warner Brothers, Mattel (kudos to them for having the sense of humor), and an artist like Greta Gerwig that we're able to have her take something so deeply established in the pop culture and marry it with the standalone work of an artist and its integrity. The result is something I've never seen in a theater before.In a scene where Barbie is experiencing an emotional breakdown, Gloria transitions into a long-running monologue about how it was like for her to be a woman in today's world. I sat and watched and thought it might had been something a bit clichéd and worn out. Everyone had settled into silence. Then the moment Gloria was done with the monologue, there was a pause, with her and with the audience, then the whole room erupted into applause! I joined right in! What the hell did I know... When the movie kept getting more and more exciting, and just transitioned into a modern-day musical set-piece this time around, people were so with it they had to applaud again. It was a truly great thing to see. (US audiences and people in Marvel movies are known to cheer for many things, but this was a different degree of sincerity.) At the end of it there was a buzz in the room, like everyone had just been part of something special.Essentially you know it's a great situation, you have no idea where the movie might go next, and it keeps coming up with the right answer every single time. It's perfect.More props to Greta; like all the truly great movies, it's also very personal. At first it's personal in the relevant but quirky mention of Rocky Balboa and The Godfather as symbols of the male-revolving world-movies that she herself wanting to be a filmmaker had had to deal with as deeply cherished and highly regarded in the masculine opinion around her-and it's personal again in the ending, and what she sees as most cherishable about being human, in what will stay with me as one of the classic shots of all time. The shot comes with Margot Robbie's perfecting of the single-eyed tear and using it the way you imagine they would in the great old times of cinema, except it's that much better because the times are today.I've seen reviews (The Guardian) calling this a feminist thesis. It's neither a thesis (see Women Talking) nor a dogma. It's entirely cultural. And despite the story largely being a comedy about women banding together and helping each other break free of the omnipotent clamps of the patriarchy, Ken, who is an absolute joy in this movie, is treated to a delicate ending as well. The role was also a total gift of a role and Ryan Gosling was right there for it.It's also the movie's quality as a journey of spiritual discovery, confrontation, and self-actualization, along with the great tradition of the Hollywood ending, that bring everything together and make this a proper pop culture opus.As far as what this implies for the industry, this is the first time that we'll be able to have a strongly established director that isn't one of the folks who made their name in the 90s. This is not to say that Greta Gerwig is now going to make a Barbie every other year, nor does she have to. This is her Pulp Fiction, her Raiders of the Lost Ark, and dare I say her Godfather (wink wink). May she enjoy it. But she's definitely on my short list now of the most exciting directors working today, and someone that can carry the torch of great cinema wherever she goes next. I remember hearing her answer with Singin' in the Rain (1952) to a favorite movie question in a roundtable interview, and thinking who was this girl. Then I happened to see Singin' in the Rain a month later, and I knew that girl was cool.Finally, I'm glad that an entire generation of young girls gets to grow up with a movie like this available to them. It's definitely not something Greta's generation had, not quite. It's also a culmination of the last ten years of popular culture, which is why I think it's one of the best movies of this period. But it's also gonna be remembered and talked about for decades to come. And based on its feminist scope, it might be already one of the most important movies of the 21st century.",Barbie
7.0,Lacking Nolans Cinematography,eve_dolluk,26 July 2023,"Oppenheimer is a decent film about an important subject that gets bogged down with minor politics, we also have the nolan cut... But a nolan cut with a poor pay off.Much of the film is full of close ups and facial expression but little else in the way of cinematography that we have come to enjoy in other Nolan films.The sound was good however and is purposefully jarring. The whimsical early soundtrack is slowly obliterated by orchestral, human or explosive rumblings. Everything utilised to nail down the power of the bomb.When the story follows the bomb and the challenges Oppenheimer had running the project it makes interesting viewing. The film constantly cuts between court like sequences set 8 or 9 years later. The problem with these cuts is that the pay off was of minor importance to the overall story.The acting was good, Murphy and Depp did a great job its a shame their rivalry was pushed under the carpet while also being at the forefront of the finale. Its difficult to try and create drama over such a small footnote in the titular characters life and then infer it rather than show it.The costumes and sets and the overall appearance of the film was very good and pulled me in a lot its just a shame the story wasn't as strong nor gripping as it could have been as well as failing to even mention many aspects of the real life project.7/10.",Oppenheimer

It was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I was moved completely and entirely. I laughed, I cried, and I left the movie changed. It is a masterpiece. For those who don't understand, I highly recommend watching the movie again. The writing, the characters, the set, and the outfits were so brilliantly curated. I do not even hesitate to say it is now one of my favorite movies and one of the best movies I have EVER seen. Greta Gerwig is nothing less than a genius and deserves ALL of the recognition. The casting was perfection. The meaning behind the movie holds a special place in my heart and EVERY SINGLE PERSON NEEDS to see this movie. My favorite part of the movie was not ONLY the movie itself but the effect it is having on the communities surrounding it. The collective unspoken rule of dressing up to go see this movie. Brilliant.The conversations surrounding this movie is essential to have.I recommend to every single person. Greta Gerwig is brilliant.",Barbie

Margot Robbie added a level of depth to this character that has previously never been shown. Her performance wholeheartedly needs to garner her every award for acting. Ryan Gosling as Ken also needs awards, he was immensely funny and showed emotions at the right time. America Ferreira needs to win an award for best supporting actress, her monologue towards the end was just wow!!! The film has a ton of heart, humor and the ability to make you go from being sad, reflecting life to laughing out loud. I would highly recommend that everyone watch this film, it's quite the experience.",Barbie
8.0,I am Kenough,eoinageary,23 July 2023,"So I went into the movie with little to no expectations and I was pleasantly impressed with the movie overall.So basically the movie is about Barbie who is starting to feel emotions and not everything feels perfect in Barbieland. She ventures to the real world to discover the solution of getting everything perfect again. Barbie is joined by the one and not only KEN, Ken is obsessed with Barbie and sees her as the centre of his world, he goes to the real world and discovers patriarchy, which leads to many events.The movie overall is actually quite funny, Ryan Gosling is fantastic as Ken and the stand out for me, he needs to be many versions of Ken and he kills then all !! Margott is also great, she brings a range to Barbie, for me also Weird Barbie was great, she was funny and brought a difference.There were times I felt the ""woman power"" thing was just a bit much and took me out of the movie, I feel like the movie had that message and didn't need to shove it down your throat but it decided to at points so for me that does bring it down a notch, the daughter was also just annoying hahaha yes I get it she hated the world bla bla, she just had no redeeming qualities, otherwise no complains and I do think it's worth seeing, solid 8/10.",Barbie
1.0,Awful,claire-31904,24 July 2023,"One of the most excruciatingly boring films I have seen in a long time. No stakes, no dramatic tension, no investment in the characters. Just endless dry dialogue often overlaid with very loud music so it was hard to even hear what was being said a lot of the time. I fell asleep and was unfortunate enough to wake up again with still 2 of the 3 hours to go. If I hadn't been there with my family I would have left. Christopher Nolan seemed more intent on proving his own intelligence than being a good storyteller. The messing around with the chronology was an example of this, as for me it detracted from the story rather than enhancing it. A very important and potentially gripping subject but this film did not do it justice at all in my opinion.",Oppenheimer
8.0,A GREAT experience!!,rashedloay,20 July 2023,"What more can anyone say about Nolan movies!just his name on any poster make it an instant classic and blockbuster The cinematography is at its best and soundtrack is really good and the acting from Robert Downey Jr is spectacular! Him and Cillian Murphy will be nominated for the Oscars for sure, and Emily blunt was great specially in a scene nearing the end of the movie.I just didn't like that Nolan treat us as we are all scientist I felt a little bit lost in the first half of the movie, for me the second half was really better.But overall great experience you have to experience it in cinema!.",Oppenheimer
5.0,Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,lukell-96155,22 July 2023,"This film thinks it's the Lego Movie but is far more akin to Don't Worry Darling. Starting off in a Matriarchal society, '60s feminist paradise where every position in society is ran by women (this is never shown as oppressive or questionable) saturated with the neon pinks and pastel purples, quintessentially American and girly. All Kens are sidelined and have no meaning they are jealous of one another and simp over Barbie. Through the course of the film this paradigm is spun on its head and put back to how it was again, no fantastical change happens to this world once it is changed and fought over and won back again by the Barbies.Vapid and confused are just a few words to sum up this movie. Misandrist should be just as common as misogynist in today's vocabulary; if any film of this generation portrayed women as servile, useless, and toxic it would be slammed across the board. However in this film woman are both victorious and the victim; the oppressed and oppressor; the can-haves and the cannots. Barbie wants its pink empowered cake and wants to eat it too.I didn't expect a pro masculine message from a Barbie movie, but I also didn't expect this when asked to accompany my girlfriend. I would also never expect any woman to sit through a film that took swings and berated their gender. Is this movie harmful? Yes, a generation will be brought up to hate their fathers, brothers, and even sons. This burns bridges rather than mends them or creates new ones. It feels like a trojan horse when compared to its advertising.Many will tell you it has brains, is well written and is a fascinating commentary on society -some of that may be true. Though if truth be told it is a confused and confusing film. A feminist utopia would have women in every possible position in society, and shocked to see there were construction barbies however that no building had exterior walls or any use of windows... I don't know what this says, but the optics don't look well. The fantasy land portrayed is truly fantasy and I hope every viewer realises that.",Barbie
8.0,"An important movie, I liked a lot in it.",SPZMaxinema,24 July 2023,"Will some think this is boring? For sure. Will some think it's too long? Undoubtedly. But overall I thought this was a very quality film like most of Christopher Nolan's movies, and while this one isn't my favorite it's still good for what it is. It's a JFK-like historical drama. The acting/cast were all incredible and so was the set design, and also the lack of CGI and special effects. The directing and camera work were awesome too. The middle part with them detonating the test bomb was a very well-constructed and tense scene. It was also intelligent in a way to only show the American perspective of the war and how out of touch/indifferent they were with the suffering that they inflicted on the Japanese civilian population, except of course for the main character. He was portrayed very well and this movie is coming out at a very critical time in history, reminding us of the destructive potential of escalating to nuclear war with other countries (no matter the side) and that our responsibility with handling weaponized nuclear technology is not to be taken lightly, and we must have a moral conscience. The movie also showed the quick/immediate development of a post-war McCarthyist government which was portrayed how it should have been. This is good and informative 20th century history!",Oppenheimer
9.0,Best for Ryan Gosling Gives a really great performance acting,mckai-89546,19 July 2023,"I am a man but watched this movie it's awesome Margot Robbie very beautiful but i like the performance of Ryan Gosling a lot this movie It's full of imagination and it surprises me a lot.Especially if anyone is a Barbie fan, let me tell you, this event is very satisfying.Even I'm not looking fun. And in the movie part, it's bad comedy and teasing yourself (Warner) quite a bit .. You have to go and see for yourself and you will definitely laugh.Ryan Gosling's acting is so good, I'm sure there's a lot of laughs out there during filming.This is another very good performance for this man.What the movie does is like imagination that doesn't have to care about logic. Let's just say the story is like we're playing with dolls and assuming the role of that character...",Barbie
10.0,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!,hamadarin,20 July 2023,"First of all if you have a true IMAX cinema near you i would recommend that you go see this movie in that theatre.Oppenheimer is a movie about J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American physicist who played a significant role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II, it has the potential to be a compelling historical drama. The story of Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project is a fascinating and complex one, filled with ethical dilemmas, scientific discoveries, and the implications of nuclear weapons.Cillian Murphy and RDJ were absolutely amazing in this movie and their acting blow me away.For anyone who was hesitant about going to see this movie i would recommend that you see it right away.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Acting masterclass!,gtc-63664,22 July 2023,"Probably the most thought-provoking big-budget studio film in the last 20 years. While this was a fine film, the acting was utterly tremendous. Cillian Murphy, Robert Downy Junior, and Emily Blunt put on a true masterclass in acting, dwarfed only by the magnitude of Oppenheimer's life's work: the atomic bomb. Magnificent performances, and as far as big-budget studio films go, Oppenheimer may be second to none. The film had so many layers, and was truly one of the finest examples of the magnitude of life's everlasting consequences. It's silly to say a commercially successful movie will clean up at awards season, but it would be a travesty if the Cillian, RDJ, and Emily Blunt didn't all get a statue, as well as the sound team, and cinematography.",Oppenheimer

4.0,"Gawd, the Nolan Fanboy Reviews Are Sickening",brucecsnow,23 July 2023,"Same IMDB tripe. Masterpiece. Perfect. Flawless, blah, blah, blah. Its none of that. Its an overly long movie that at times confuses the viewers with flashbacks, BW to Color changes, historical liberties and political correctness. Don't get me wrong, This is the real Hitler and real Nazis and real antisemetism. But the whole latter half of the movie were Oppenheimer is disgraced due to his links to communism is overwrought. Didn't need to know how much of a philanderer he was. Could have fleshed out his relationship with the other scientists. At times too many characters. Good portrayal of Edward Teller.Not a date movie. Any nerd has working knowledge of this man. Nothing new revealed.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Incredible,davidmermod,24 July 2023,"(9.7) A near perfect film and easily one of the best films I've ever seen. The cast is amazing and each actor performs like they never have before, particularly Murphy and Downey. The tone of the film transforms with the plot throughtout and the movie is plauged with themes of guilt that are expertly shown through Nolan's Directing and Cillian's acting. Towards the second half of the film the directing almost has a kind of aspect of horror. The film might be 3 hours but it does not drag at all and it leaves you wanting more by the end. The best scene is the scene containing the detonation of the atomic bomb.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Experience of a lifetime,speedobrunoldj,20 July 2023,"This was genuinely without a doubt the first movie I witnessed that made experience and sink away and forget everything around me.The sounds, the shots.. the double story that goes at the same time. I want to watch it again.Seeing Albert Einstein made me so happy for reasons I don't understand. And only near the end I realised Strauss is Robert Downey Jr.Great cast led by one of my favorite actors nowadays. So maybe I'm a bit biased.A movie like this makes me so happy I'm alive and greatly enjoy and experience emotions when I'm in the cinema. That I don't care that I show emotions in cinema.

8.0,"Oppenheimer Goes Nuclear, If You Know What I Mean.",Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,24 July 2023,"What's up, Streamers? Today, it's the ""-Enheimer"" to your ""Barb-"". The other half of the internet phenomenon is a 3-hour, epic biopic from Christopher Nolan. Nolan takes his fascination with physics from the imagined worlds of Interstellar, Inception and Tenet and places it squarely in the terrifyingly real historical context of the development of the atomic bomb.In this corner, coming in at 5 ft. 10 in., it's American theoretical physicist and father of the atomic bomb - J. Robert Oppenheimer.Oppenheimer tells the story of the rise and fall of the tenacious and brilliant scientist and leader of the Manhattan Project, J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), as his team develops the atomic bomb and the subsequent personal and political fallout from it. The film tells the story through contrasting hearings that occur after the atomic bomb is used to end World War II: a hearing to strip Oppenheimer of his security clearance and the Senate confirmation hearing of Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey, Jr.) as Secretary of Commerce under President Eisenhower. Mushroom cloud and Communist witch-hunting hijinks ensue.For a dense historical biopic, Oppenheimer has the feeling of a taut, espionage thriller or like a psychological drama thanks to Christopher Nolan's direction. There's so much tension built up throughout the movie despite the fact that we know what happened to these people. Nolan does a really good job of connecting Oppenheimer's concerns post-development of the atomic bomb to our existential threats today. Beyond that, the budget of this movie was well-spent. There are a ton of familiar faces throughout. Even if you don't really know Cillian Murphy as a leading man, there's Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Robert Downey. Jr. And many cameos. The sound and visual effects that are used to enhance the science of creating the bomb and setting it off are amazing.At 3-hours, the movie starts to lose some steam when the focus shifts from developing the bomb to grappling with what the existence of the bomb means. This is an important and compelling question, but it is told through these competing administrative hearings that aren't as propulsive as the science driving the first part of the movie. Also, the motivations and connections between characters gets a little confusing because there are so many characters and competing interests to keep track of. Nolan does a good job of orienting the timeframes of the movie by differentiating between black and white cinematography and color and the editing keeps things moving quickly. On the other hand, there are a lot of similar looking dudes saying scientific and political jargon that it can be disorienting.Sidebar: Oppenheimer reminds me of something like There Will Be Blood except Oppenheimer, himself, isn't a complete psychopath like Daniel Plainview.Ultimately, Oppenheimer is an urgent and thrilling historical drama that makes relevant connections to our world today. Christopher Nolan puts his unique stamp on the stylish crafts and has assembled a sprawling cast. Although the movie is 3-hours long, it is edited well enough to avoid feeling slow or boring. It is worthy of a viewing on the big screen, so get a big enough box of popcorn to last you the entire runtime.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Unexpectedly totally awesome,jillweeland,25 July 2023,"When I'm going to see a movie I don't do research beforehand. I like to make up my own mind and hate spoilers.

People who say it's not just don't get it. For real.The full message is round up at the very end.I laughed, I cried, it truly hit me right in the feels.The set was out of this world.

10.0,A true cinematic event with the most unnerving onscreen explosion ever,sophaljonesy,25 July 2023,"I don't really know how to describe a cinematic experience but I think Oppenheimer should be counted as one. You are absorbed into the story, and feel immersed into this world. The movie plays like a thriller slowly revealing new details. Nolan is a master of playing the story non-linearly, but the use of colors contrasting with black and white clearly distinguishes the timeline. We see the lead up to the building of the atomic bomb, and the aftermath. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer is just killing it (pun intended), needless to say. I see there is a solid casting and every supporting actor grabs your attention. Even Florence Pugh's small role in the movie is interesting. Emily Blunt's talent is not wasted even with the little screen time she is given. I can say every sensory experience you can get from a movie is fully exploited. The use of sound is very much part of the story, and keeps you feeling anxious throughout. You also feel Cillian's Oppenheimer. I mean Nolan literally bares his character just to show his state of mind and emotion. This is done in various scenes. I could feel the shock Oppenheimer felt when he was cheered on by crowds after learning of the deaths caused by his invention. Whatever emotional journey Oppenheimer is experiencing, I could feel it. I also like how the science is explained simply, and I could grasp the idea of how an atomic bomb works. It was great to see what physicists I had only heard of in name on screen such as Niels Borh, Heisenberg, and most importantly Einstein. It was like the Avengers of geeks, and three hours did not feel long. Robert Downey Jr was brilliant as Lewis Strauss, and I see he channeled a bit of Tony Stark too, but in the unlikable side. Matt Damon was great too, and I like his back and forth with Cillian Murphy. The best part is the explosion scene, and that is worth the wait. I could say they could have ended the movie shortly after the explosion though. Yet, the explosion scene was perfectly executed. It was tense, and showcases the most powerful and unnerving atomic explosion scene in cinema. Nolan perfectly shows how dangerous an atomic bomb is without showing any death, and the impact of it lingers even as the story continues after the explosion. I certainly believe that Oppenheimer will be one of the most important movies of the decade if not of all time. I may even watch it again on the big screen, and yes you do need to watch it on the big screen to fully enjoy it.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Great but long!!!,kcrateau,21 July 2023,"Saw this tonight at a premier party in Oak Ridge, TN of all places. Packed house. Sold out in all theatres. Gotta admit I wish I had gone to imax just for a few scenes, but really, most of the movie was really about political drama as opposed to the atomic bomb. I was really impressed with the acting and think Cillian Murphy deserves an Oscar. Nolan-maybe. Downey, probably no. I liked him and he did a great job, don't get me wrong, but I'll admit, until I realized the motivations of his character I didn't really understand his significance. Movie could have done a better job at pointing out what the political points were in the second half because I was little lost. I did think that the final third of the movie dragged a little but maybe that's because I was in about my 5th hour at the theatre, with the premier pre activities, and was pretty tired. I will say that, for me, the payoff was, after all the congressional hearings and back room interrogation, the last two minutes. It brought it all together for me. So, while I did love this movie, I can't quite give it past an 8 for some of the aspects that didn't just quite make it the experience I thought it was going to be.",Oppenheimer

8.0,"Good craftsmanship, but...",nzbmgpuxk-33213,21 July 2023,"I'm not the fan type. I know that many people like the film because it projects their inner fear, while we get to know the man and the one who wanted to disable him. I also know that a knife can kill people and slice bread, it just depends on the user. I also know that the younger generation, who are only living in the current heightened political situation, are full of emotion and passion.The film makes it clear that physics and chemistry are not interested in the human belief system, nuclear fusions have no emotion, merely chemical reaction.However, the work could have highlighted the fact that, as RD jr. The personal emotions and past grievances of the leaders of the countries on a global level lead to major disasters.

3.0,Not for little girls. Not for anyone actually.,gdin-30820,23 July 2023,"What could have been a cute concept was overproduced with obvious writer infighting pulling this disaster into all directions. A little girl friendly opening act quickly dissolves into act two social discussion that would leave any little girl bewildered. The family next to us described their three little ones as totally confused and everyone they heard discussing it was very disappointed with this disaster caused by feuding writers or a director who scored hilarious with ""Good Boys"". So, not for kids, and parents should wait for home viewing so they can turn it off when it wears really thin about a half hour in: the time it is realized its just not going to get any better and you turn it off thankful you didn't waste any money.",Barbie
8.0,A triumph,PedroPires90,20 July 2023,"I appreciated it but wasn't a huge fan of Greta Gerwig's first two films. I knew absolutely nothing about Barbie except that it was a doll. The trailers didn't impress me. I slept less than an hour last night. I watched the movie alone surrounded by teenagers who cheered when the WB logo appeared in pink.The conditions were set for this to go wrong, but Gerwig's vision for Barbie won me over. The film starts in the perfect, goofy, and funny Barbie Land, but it doesn't take long to move to the real world. Curiously, while most of the action in the real world works well, it's also where I felt some issues, mainly with the Mattel executives' characters. Let's say it was the only time I felt that the silliness of the film (and it's indeed very silly) went too far. The third act wraps everything up perfectly, with some fantastic speeches and a strong conclusion. Margot Robbie is great in the role of Barbie, but there's a big surprise in America Ferrera, and Ryan Gosling steals all the attention whenever he's on screen. All the supporting cast is hilarious.Younger audiences will love the colours, the incredible production design, and the light tone. However, this is a very adult film in the themes it addresses, managing to be highly relevant without ever ceasing to entertain. The feminist traits are well-defined, and it's an homage to women, but not only that. It's primarily about self-discovery, finding our own path, and being true to ourselves.",Barbie

6.0,Fun film whose script falls in on itself,mark-217-307033,19 July 2023,"Margot Robbie's performance is perfect, and no other actor could've embodied the character as well as she does. However, Ryan Gosling is the film-stealer. I often forget his comedic talent, and he's given a lot of room to flex it in this. A cleverly executed Matchbox Twenty joke is particularly memorable.While cynics and perhaps realists will argue that the film is primarily a marketing vehicle to sell Barbie dolls, it does attempt to carry a moral message. However, the commercial aspect of the movie undercuts the credibility of this message somewhat.The movie starts off well, being smartly self-aware and offering a tongue-in-cheek critique of itself with many winks to the audience. However, as it progresses, the commentary on feminism and the patriarchy becomes heavy-handed, especially in the dialogue-heavy third act, which weighs down the overall narrative.The set and wardrobe designs are a standout. I think kids will love this part alone, even if some of the humor and social commentary will go over their heads.Overall, it's a fun film but not without its flaws. It's likely to spark discussion due to its blunt societal commentary. If you're looking for a visually impressive movie to entertain the kids, and you're willing to enjoy it without analyzing its message too deeply, then it's an enjoyable watch.",Barbie

It brilliantly showcase of what happens to a person whether they're a genius of Oppenheimer's ranks or not, when they have to choose between evils, the only difference being one will be attributed to them while under their control at the same time.The movie's presence today is more than needed, in a time which can be defined by rapid change.

7.0,Conflict Barbie,Entertainmentsparadise,21 July 2023,"Barbie offers a delightful and fun-filled experience, encompassing chuckles, joy, and, surprisingly, some deeper discussions surrounding its creation's intended impact on feminism versus the portrayal of opposing views on women in real life. It even delves into the influence of patriarchy, hyper-masculinity, and its effects on the mental and emotional struggles women face daily. Initially, I found myself a bit confused since it wasn't quite what I expected. The movie touched on dark themes like death, which left me wanting more answers, especially since it was mentioned often, but it didn't tie up that loose end.Despite that, the film doesn't target kids but rather adults who once played with Barbies. For the moms out there, it's definitely a movie worth watching.However, I'm conflicted because it felt like the movie couldn't quite decide what it wanted to accomplish. With so many themes and stories to tell, it somewhat detracts from the overall impact. Nevertheless, it remains an enjoyable experience that nostalgically brings back memories. I'd give Barbie The Movie a rating of 7.5/10. The hype, dressing up, and reliving childhood memories add to its appeal.",Barbie
5.0,Feels like watching a three-hour-long film trailer,maurice_anemaat,22 July 2023,"Capturing a wide array of historic events, characters and themes into one all-encompassing movie proves to be a difficult challenge for any director, and this one is no different.The audiovisual spectacle and certain performances (Robert Downey jr. In example) aside, the majority of scenes felt chaotic, sudden, and lacked length, leaving you with a constant sense of getting outpaced and needing to catch up. It's not necessarily the complexity of the chosen themes, but directional choices in how to portray them, that makes Oppenheimer feel like an overextended film trailer. Watching this is a Sisyphean task if you ask me.",Oppenheimer
10.0,"Amazing Cinema, But More Than That",jacksonorbin,25 July 2023,"Nolan has done it again as he tells a tight and amazing story matched with great visuals, cinematography, and score while leaving you deeply connecting with the theme of the film. I left the theatre today not to claps or conversation but it was silent, and the reason I was silent is because diving into that story and the mind of Oppenheimer it really shows how complex of a time it was and leaves you in a grey area, up to your interpretation. I've always view nuclear bombs as the destroyer of worlds as Oppenheimer puts it, yet it has led to the longest relative peace time that we have seen.Along side with the free existential crisis, Oppenheimer also delivered with amazing performances from Murphy, Downey Jr. And blunt. Watching these three well known actors I didn't even notice them, I was totally lost in 1940 with them being able to feel everything they felt truly great performances.These are the type of films I miss from Hollywood, something that challenges the viewer something that was made with a clear vision that was done how it was meant to be done, a director and it's cast with no big wig effecting the production.",Oppenheimer
4.0,Boring!,trozhon,23 July 2023,Yes technically great filmmaking. But sooo boring. Why is the central conflict around the appointment of a potential secretary of commerce? Weren't there richer moral issues to mine in the creation of the bomb? Politicians. Courtrooms and conference rooms.Murphy was excellent. Robert Downey Jr a disappointment. Blunt did what she could with a small part. Damon lit it up and energized the screen in his small part. Pugh's character inessential to the plot but I guess that's how we got the nudity in?I was really looking forward to this as a Nolan fan and a history lover. What a slog.

3.0,Nice scenography,musajasna,20 July 2023,"Well, scenography is nice, wardrobe is nice and actress are pretty. The plot is non existent and the whole movie tries to be something it's not - a social commentary so it dives in whole other area and topics and fails. I didn't have any expectations coming to the cinema, I just assumed it was light and funny movie but instead I got a speech about patriarchy and men's world. Not to say it isn't but it's not something you would expect from a Barbie movie that was marketed as fun and comedy movie.Development of the characters is non existent so they are constantly changing their mood and personality without any explanation.",Barbie
10.0,Great movie,steven_torrey,22 July 2023,"I found the movie difficult to follow at first. I've seen ""Fat Man and Little Boy"" and ""In The Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer"" so I knew pretty much the parameters of the story.""Fat Man and Little Boy"" (with Paul Newman as General Leslie Groves) is a fairly straightforward narration of the development of the atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert. ""In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer"" a 1968 stage play by Heinar Kipphardt about the security clearance taken away from J. Robert Oppenheimer, for his sympathies for the Communist Party, by Lewis Straus; I believe it became a PBS production. So, I had a fairly good background in the story. I thought to myself, as the movie unfolded with numerous flashbacks, how confusing this film would be without that background information and how easily lost the audience could be.What is the subject matter of the movie is a more challenging question: is it simply about the development of a destructive bomb or is it about the moral implications of scientists developing a bomb, and their regret for being involved in development of weapons of mass destruction?The movie starts out with a quote from the Bhagavad Gita: ""Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."" And Oppenheimer quotes the line with the first explosion of the atomic bomb, July 16, 1945. But there is a refrain from the get-go of the film of scientists creating such a destructive weapon. And the response that quiets the argument, ""If Hitler had such a weapon, he would not hesitate to use it."" And there is something disquieting about a background chant that to me sounded like jackboots of marching Nazis, as if to reinforce the question. Jackboots of any totalitarian state. (And what seemed unthinkable in 1945, now in 2023 so many nations own nuclear weapons, that any flash incident can end in nuclear holocaust. And North Korea insists on developing nuclear weapons for the sole purpose of destroying America.)Peace comes to Europe in May before the Atom Bomb is finalized, but war continues in Japan. Truman orders the attack on Hiroshima and Nagasaki to bring a final and forceful end to what could be a projected battle to the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives.Oppenheimer goes to Truman to bemoan the loss of life, that he feels personally responsible for; Truman is less than thrilled and never wants to see the ""crybaby"" (his words) Oppenheimer ever again.Subsequent to the war, Lewis Straus, who in reality was indeed a very vindictive, mean spirited, petty person, wants Oppenheimer's security clearance taken away for his sympathies with the American Communist Party, of which his brother Frank is also an active member.I saw the movie at San Francesco Balboa Theatre (35mm print) and they allowed for two breaks at the hour and 2-hour point of the three-hour movie. (I wouldn't detect the difference between IMax & 35 mm, ...)It is not so terribly confusing a movie, it soon follows a straightforward narrative, but it is something of a challenge to follow.",Oppenheimer
10.0,And the oscar for the best actor goes to Cillian Murphy,lamajoseph-93471,21 July 2023,"I recently watched the movie, and it's yet another masterpiece from Nolan. Although I saw it in a regular theater since we don't have an IMAX in our country, I was still deeply moved by what I experienced during the 3-hour film. I can only imagine how incredible it must have been for those who saw it in its intended format. Murphy's on-screen presence was never in doubt, and Cillian's portrayal finally showcases what a great actor he truly is. Nolan's promise to show everything through Oppenheimer's eyes was brilliantly captured, especially through Cillian's expressive and captivating eyes. His performance made a lasting impression on me. Robert displayed not only his star power but also his exceptional acting skills, delivering one of the most memorable performances in the second half of the movie. As expected from Nolan, this film sets a new milestone. The move had an every element served to the viewers. It surpassed my already high expectations, thanks to the remarkable cast, compelling story, stunning cinematography, and Nolan's dedication. I feel fortunate to have witnessed this epic film, and I believe both Cillian and Robert deserve Oscars for their outstanding performances. Without a doubt, it's the best movie of the year.",Oppenheimer
4.0,"Enjoy the movie, feminists!",lenikut,23 July 2023,"Barbie is the problem with modern Hollywood. I'm not a sexist, but this movie shows how all men are trash. The ending drags so long, just tell ""the message"". There are some gags that landed and the whole theater, packed with girls, laughed, but there were some, where the theatre was quite and i could hear only the fart of the woman sitting next to me. If the main villian Will Farrel, wasn't there, the movie is gonna be a little better, because the villians do nothing and only drag the pace of the movie. Greta Gerwig for the most part, did a pretty good job and the casting is perfect. Ryan Gosling is born for this role and Margot Robbie is great, as i expected. Overall, the movie is not for me. The little girls will deffinely like a lot more, than i did.",Barbie
7.0,Learn to love the bomb.,sbweightman,22 July 2023,"An informative and dramatic biopic on the father of the atomic bomb, but it's not as stylish or atmospheric as Nolan's other films.- - - -- - - - - -It's an engaging and interesting story covering powerful topics with some tension in the first half as they race to create the bomb followed by a 'legal drama' aftermath in the second. Superb acting performances from the varied cast and the science was demonstrated and explained well, but the sex scenes felt out of place and the visuals, although impressive, were too few and far between.Overall, i would score Oppenheimer as a seven out of ten.",Oppenheimer
1.0,A plane without engines,whats_shaken_22,21 July 2023,"Imagine arriving at the airport, ready to board a flight, only to discover that the plane has no engines. Consequently, there will be no trip. Well, this movie is no different. It lacks taste, is tedious, excessively long, and lacks a solid vision or cinematography. Christopher Nolan's amateurish script, underdeveloped characters, unnecessary soundtracks, and arrogant cinematic perspective have ruined the film. I fail to comprehend the overhyped praise surrounding this movie. Furthermore, the recommendation to watch it in IMAX theaters is baffling. Additionally, the movie focuses on Oppenheimer, yet even after enduring a lengthy three hours, there are numerous gaps in the storyline, leaving me feeling the need to conduct extensive research to grasp how and why these events occurred.I hold great admiration for Christopher Nolan's previous works such as ""The Prestige,"" ""Insomnia,"" ""Interstellar,"" and ""Inception,"" but this particular film is a major disappointment.As a side note, I was compelled to reserve my ticket 72 hours in advance due to the full capacity of IMAX theaters. However, I can confidently say that there is no discernible difference between watching this movie on a 6-inch cellphone or in an IMAX theater. Ultimately, there isn't a single visually captivating scene to savor!",Oppenheimer
10.0,Everyone watch this,kimberlyely-27550,25 July 2023,"BarbieDid you grow up playing with Barbie's? If so, you probably know that not everyone likes the idea of Barbie. Some people think Barbie's are harmful to children. Other people love Barbie. This new movie called, Barbie, explores why Barbie could be problematic. Greta Gerwig is the director, previously she directed Little Women. It stars Margot Robbie from Birds of Prey and Suicide Squad, Ryan Gosling from The Notebook and La La Land, Michael Cera from Arrested Development, Helen Mirren, and Rhea Perlman.In 1959, Ruth Handler, the co-founder of the Mattel toy company, created Barbie. She wanted this doll to inspire little girls to dream and know they can be whatever they want. This thought process seems sexist, it leaves out little boys, who also can be whatever they want. The movie will show you that Handler's idea that Barbie will make society better, hasn't worked out as she probably wanted. Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken (Ryan Gosling) live in Barbie land, where women are in charge. Barbie needs to travel to the real world, where she discovers men are in charge and she isn't the inspiration she thought she was.Robbie plays two sides of the same character, at first Barbie is very carefree in Barbie land, and oblivious to all societies' problems. When she gets to the real world however, she discovers things seem to be the opposite from where she came from. Not only is Gosling nice to look at but he also will make the audience laugh. Ken has always felt left out of Barbie land, until he travels to the real world with Barbie. Unfortunately, he learns the wrong lesson from capitalism. He finds out men are in charge, and wants that for Barbie land. What his take away should have been however, is that men and women can both hold equal power. Alan (Michael Cera) doesn't have a duplicate, therefore he knew who he was from the beginning. He has good morals and values, which gives him confidence to be the best version of himself. Meanwhile, Ken and Barbie are struggling to figure out who they are, and want to be.The dancing, choreography, and facial expressions were all done spectacularly well. The cast, including the supporting characters did a wonderful job. Gosling does an excellent job, portraying a more submissive Ken in the beginning, then more dominant, when he wants to take charge of Barbie land. Robbie's role as Barbie was much different than when she played Harley Quinn. Barbie is nice, kind, and not evil, while Harley Quinn is a criminal, who could be good from time to time. These roles show she is good at playing different parts, which will help her in the future.Not only does this movie have some funny moments, but it also has themes that are relevant to what's happening in life today. Capitalism, equality for all, female empowerment, and self-acceptance, are all things people need to know about.There is a lot of pressure on women to be perfect. Women have to go to work, which usually means getting payed less than men, taking care of the house and kids, all while looking their best, which is difficult to do all the time. Mattel hoped that Barbie would be an inspiration for women. Unfortunately, she doesn't even look like most people, Barbie is extremely skinny, which is an unrealistic standard for anyone to live up to. Along with that, the company, Mattel, and its founders aren't exactly honest people. Years after Barbie was made, Handler was found guilty of tax evasion.Barbie shows one of the reasons the WGA (Writers Guild of America) and SAG (Screen Actors Guild) are striking. They all want better pay, meanwhile the top CEO's of company's make millions a year. However, the way it should be is more equal, meet somewhere in the middle. Don't pay people so little they need multiple jobs to support their family, but also no one is asking to become a millionaire. Barbie is a good movie that happened to come out at the perfect time. I would encourage everyone to go see this movie. It was well cast and has multiple messages surrounding issues our society faces today.",Barbie
10.0,Fantastic!,rtvumdvh,23 July 2023,"TLDR: this is what Hollywood has needed for a long time!I'll be honest I went into this movie with pretty high expectations. Being a fanatic of the great scientist behind the manhattan project I wanted to see their lives given justice in this film.And well I was simply impressed with the story telling of this film. The way Nolan filmed three perspectives of the same story. Weaving the threads of the joy of scientific discovery, the political conflicts and the moral implications of the A bomb. And showing it in an expertly written sequence.I was impressed by the acting by all the actors from the leads to the extras the entire cast really embodied their characters. In simple terms it would be amazing to see more films like this!",Oppenheimer
10.0,This movie is for EVERYONE,jenbixler,25 July 2023,I never have done a movie review because I have never seen one worth reviewing till Now!!!!!!!This movie went above my expectations. So rare to happen in the movie industry! Both main characters rocked the screen this is a must see for the whole family!!!!Go see it you won't regret it I promise!!!I loved so much from beginning to end! Like the trailer said it's for you if you love Barbie and it's for you if you hate Barbie. So many laugh out loud moments!So aesthetically pleasing!Beautiful sets!Beautiful story!I will definitely be buying it when it is available to own!! Its so good in so many different ways!!,Barbie
7.0,Must admit I struggled!,paulhopfish,24 July 2023,"I guess my starting point was not a huge fan of anything Barbie, but to be honest I went in moderately openminded. The film was dull at times and at others quite subversive!Some great humour some odd moments, felt a little stilted but that was clearly the intent of the film makers.I sat through it feeling at the end mildly perplexed and unsure if I enjoyed it or not.I felt it was at times quite clever but still a bit confusing much of the time.As a 67 year old I may not be the best judge nor did the chatting 7-8 year old two seats away from me add much to the experience.Go see and make your mind up, overall I much preferred Oppenheimer.",Barbie
3.0,Nolan is not Sorkin,sctmcg,23 July 2023,"This was one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.I truly do not understand the hype - I have loved ALL of Nolan's previous works but he's stepped far away from his comfort zone in this feature. It's a style of movie that I would enjoy if I was heading in knowing it was written by Aaron Sorkin - a movie of this pace requires such a talent in order to survive. However, as Nolan is not Sorkin, the script and pace are equally interminable to the point where I had to walk out after 2 hours just to save time in my life.Honestly by the time I left, I didn't even know what was happening in the story or, quite frankly, why Nolan thought it would be interesting enough to tell - I can now understand why this story hasn't been told before.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Bio-Epic,nihalat-27063,27 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan has already made a case for why he is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time with films like Interstellar, Inception, Dunkirk and Prestige. Now he has come up with another film that elevates his one of a kind of filmography and pushes the envelope of what defines him as a Filmmaker.Oppenheimer is not your run-of-the-mill Nolan film, it's a character study at it's heart, a film exploring a peculiar mind and the rather unusual circumstances it found itself under.Every detail is carefully crafted. The first half of the film was a bit tedious at times but it all plays out in the end beautifully. The way the multiple subtexts of the film were driven home is as fitting as it is engaging.I Absolutely loved Robert Downey Jr's performance, definitely one of the stand outs. Cillian Murphy lived and breathed as J Robert Oppenheimer, there is not a cell in me that isn't convinced the man on screen was the father of the Atomic Bomb. The Visual flair that Hoyte van Hoytema and Nolan brought is so fresh and welcome especially considering how none of it's CGI. I have heard complaints about heavy exposition but I never noticed any.It's less of a Crowdpuller and more of an Award winner than it seems, it might help to tune your expectations.",Oppenheimer
5.0,Movie is playing while I'm writing this...,codyfleury,22 July 2023,"The result is important, but that's about it and e all already know that. The story is boring and the movie is the most pretentious thing I have seen in a long time. I get it, the result is a big deal, probably the biggest deal known to human kind. But the movie isn't telling me anything I don't already know nor is it making it seem interesting but oh boy it sure is trying. It's sad cause Cillian has been one of my favorite actors. But the movie seems like a whole movie saying ""this is important and we are important people telling you how important this is"". We get it. Was looking forward to this WAY more than Barbie, but honestly Barbie wins. Im fighting hard to stay awake for the second half.....GOD THE SECOND HALF! I have to go back in now, let's see if I can do it.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Amazing,Spaghettimuncher,22 July 2023,"Me and my friend have been dying to see this film for months, we thought it would be a funny silly movie but its was so much more.There were so many emotional scenes that left me on the verge of tears the ending scene was honestly so incredibly emotional but it was amazing.Margot robbie was an amazing casting choice she played the role of barbie so fantastically, the casting choice for ken could have been better but honestly ryan gosling did amazing at his role aswell.Honestly this movie healed my inner child it was so amazing and i definitely recommend you go and see it because the movie actually is very funny but you probably will end up tearing up at some point.",Barbie
6.0,OK,willeandersen,20 July 2023,"The movie is okay if you wanna have a laugh and entertainment.The script is a bit weird but it has it point.Goslint and Margot are so good in their characters.The first 45 are a bit intensive and laughable. But ""the second half"" are enjoyable with a fun and more realistic view.Barbie shows and tells the hard lite of a woken in the real world but also the hard world of Ken in the barbie world.The moviemaker takes up the life of barbies that our childhood was obsessed with. Clothes,cars,houses and characters in a perfect way.The movie has a cirkus plot and a bit raily but in the end it is OK.",Barbie
10.0,Hilarious with genuine touches of emotion,thomasduggins,22 July 2023,"I went in to this movie expecting to it to be fun based on the trove a press for it.It does not disappoint. Margot Robbie brought a depth of emotion to the role that makes it a special character and performance. America Ferrera also was sensational and is probably an under appreciated actor for as much as she consistently delivers in her films and shows.Gosling, Liu, and Kingsley Ben-Adir brought plenty of the expected levity for the Ken roles. Gosling is well known for both his dramatic and comedic abilities at this point, but selfishly watching him ham it up and be funny never gets old.As expected, the movie had plenty of ludicrously silly moments that and brought humor from a lot of different directions and perspectives.Specifically, the mini-dissection of the patriarchy and evolution of the characters to more fully realize themselves played very well to me.I could not recommend this movie enough. As worthwhile as any two hours you can spend.",Barbie
5.0,Not for those expecting a fun slice of nostalgia,soneil12,23 July 2023,"I saw this movie expecting a bit of fun with perhaps some moral messages and a few jokes thrown in for the grown-ups. Perhaps pitched slightly older than the pixar films. What I got was a movie that had me laughing in some spots while other spots had me thinking, ""what on earth am I watching.""I know Barbie better than you're average middle age guy since I've been buying special edition Barbie dolls for years for my (now adult) daughter who collects them. The movie did a great job of showing some of the classic outfits and play sets that would have been recognised by the fans so the nostalgia fuel was definitely there. Cameos from unexpected stars were also a treat.There were some legitimately hilarious moments. Such as the quip about N Sync which gave me a smile - given Ryan Gosling and Justin Timberlake's shared history (they both starred in the Mickey Mouse club show - plus the long running rumours about Gosling almost becoming a member of rival band Backstreet Boys). A huge laugh in the cinema came from Narrator Helen Mirren's quip about casting. The casting itself was great, especially Robbie and Gosling who were both superb in their respective roles.Other than the humourous moments, there were also moments that were uncomfortable or downright depressing. It's not uncommon to have moments like that in comedy movies or kids movies. In this movie though, they out-weighed the lighter moments. The marketing certainly didn't lead me to expect a movie that would leave me feeling depressed afterward. Despite being based on one of the most popular toys of all time, it's definitely not a movie that was made for kids.There has always been controversy around Barbie's awkward relationship with feminism. The movie attempted to address equality by showing a Barbieland where females dominated and males like Ken were treated unfairly. Then contrasting that with the real world where men dominate and women are treated unfairly. It's a legitimate message and I expected it to build up to a conclusion showing that neither should be the case and everyone should be equal. They attempted that, but pretty much glossed over it before rushing on to the ending which was one of the film's biggest ??? Moments. The speeches about patriarchy were valid but were also dragged out repeatedly over the last half of the film in such a heavy handed manner that many would have tuned out from that message. Meanwhile, any attempt at promoting equality was undermined by every single man I remember in the film being portrayed as adorably failing at being macho, or completely stupid. In most cases both. Of course the barbies were barbies but the real world women were portrayed as being regular, intelligent women. Not cartoonish buffoons like all the men were.On balance, I can now understand all the comparisons between this movie an Oppenheimer. The difference is that your average viewer would watch Oppenheimer expecting a lot of it to feel oppressive and depressing.",Barbie
9.0,"Not a Barbie Fan, But this is a good movie!!!",tnb-66515,23 July 2023,"This movie is so good. It is existential, funny, childish, and adult at the same time.It is uncomfortable in the way that it perverts reality turning it on its head, and it forces the audience to confront the uncomfortable truths about reality that we have normalized.This movie invokes a deep sense of sentimentalism, hope, and the beauty of ideas and dreams.Also, can we talk about Margot Robbie???? Does this woman have Oscars, because she is so freaking amazing. When I heard that Margot Robbie was going to be Barbie I was leery. Could Harley Quinn really embody the larger than life legacy of Barbie???Who would Barbie be? Really, a white Barbie with blonde hair as the main character? Isn't that so stereotypical?????Well, let me tell you something. Margot Robbie should give a master class on acting. That woman needs to take a freaking bow and so does Greta Gerwing. I mean seriously...!!! Margot Robbie going from Wolf on Wallstreet, to Harley Quinn, to Babylon, now to Barbie.How does the woman embody two opposing emotions at once with such precision and authenticity????Well, enough fan girl-ing. This movie is awesome. It's a little on the nose with all the patriarchy stuff, but I think it needs to be. It's as though it marches right up to all the critiques it knows it will have and dares them to say something.It reminds me of something a man on tik-tok said recently. Men are told that they are supposed to be respected by women, and respectful women often go unheard. Well, this movie is anything but respectful. It gives patriarchy the 🐦 and reminds us that we are all important not because of our gender but in spite of it.Go out and watch it. Take your kids. You'll laugh, you'll wince, you'll feel excited, you'll dream, you'll empathize, and you'll believe.",Barbie
1.0,Faberge egg movie of the summer,pcccflores,26 July 2023,"This movie has great visuals, and the clothes Barbie wears take me back to my childhood especially the barbie house! Unfortunately, this movie reminds me of a Faberge egg so nice on the outside and beautiful to look at, but there isn't much to see on the inside in this case. Such a waste of millions of dollars that went into this film, but yet there is only a nice beginning, and the rest of the movie is just filled with long dialogue, preachy preach lines that go on into tangents, and they make look guys look super dumb in this film which is messed up lol. I think I like the barbie doll and ken batter in toy story haha. By the way this movie is not for little ones! It will go over their heads LOL.",Barbie
8.0,Gerwig must have wielded a pen that ignites,kasserlannister,20 July 2023,"Barbie wasn't supposed to be that deep but it was. Greta Gerwig must have wielded a pen that ignites to write this story down with so much boldness, creativity, and awareness that no one could ever imagine for an already perfect plastic to deserve.It wasn't a surprise Margot Robbie could kill this role and make us all believe she was born for this because she was. She is my favorite actress after all. She led the film as perfectly as her Barbie but it was Ryan Gosling that took me by surprise with how much he embodied kenergy that came so explosive like some atomic bomb designed by some civilian scientist (pun intended). Then there's America Ferrera (watch our for the scenes that earned her the ""heart of the film"" ribbon) and the scene Billie Eilish's ""What Was I Made For"" was made for. (If I were to predict with all confidence who's bagging an Oscar nomination? It's Billie for Original Song.)Barbie indeed subverted expectations and stereotypes. And I hate that it worked, that's why I loved it.",Barbie
7.0,Sound editing is the real hero of this film,ShaanChaudhry,21 July 2023,"A solid film by Nolan but it is worth mentioning to some that if you're expecting action you will be tremendously disappointed. This is a biography of Oppenheimer that focuses on key moments of his life. What drove this movie for me was the top notch quality of acting and the sound/compositions which were instrumental in bringing out the drama within a lot of the dialogue and the acting chops throughout the movie. Please be warned that the overwhelming majority of this movie is dialogue.While both Interstellar and Inception were extremely deep films from Nolan(and in my opinion his best work), there was a popcorn quality about those films where you could loosen up and not take the experience too seriously and still find it entertaining. With Oppenheimer you better pay close attention to the dialogue and what's going on because you will be lost. With that being said it is rewarding getting a glimpse of the drama surrounding the development of nuclear weapons, some of the darkest times in human history. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer will be his defining role of a lifetime. The acting from the cast was flawless along with the brilliant sound editing. I expect this film will be force to be reckoned with at the Oscars.",Oppenheimer
7.0,It's Barbie and It's Ken,dorMancyx,24 July 2023,"On a comedic level, Barbie is perfect. Obviously aware of trending topics and internet memes, the movie never fails to burst waves of laughter every three to five minutes. Every element in this film will become a punchline at one point or another, including awkward dialogues, exaggerated movements, unexpected responses, the Sex Education trio, John Cena cameo, Helen Mirren's epic one-liner, and much more. One actor to be complimented is Ryan Gosling, who bestows a childly himbo character Ken with charismatic idiocy and amusing lightheartedness, in great contrast to his previous sigma characters like K from Blade Runner 2049.In terms of story, though, not much success can be claimed. With the movie's central conflict revolve around gender inequity, Barbie highlights the problem clearly, but provides an ambiguous answer. Although Gloria's monologue was unquestionably badass, both her and Sasha's character arcs are quite unconvincing. In general, the film gives either opaque or passive solutions to gender issues, which align with mainstream opinion, but are inherently fantastical especially with the plain storyline.In my opinion, Barbie's box office wonder largely results from its marketing, whether the grand casting, the luring mystique, or the bombastic pink. And yes, the movie is incredible for its aestheticism and creativity, but the story is overly fantastical and lacking gravity.",Barbie
1.0,What a mess did I just watch for 3 hours,madabelemsantos,24 July 2023,"As an admirer of Nolan's work, I am very disappointed. First of all, the soundtrack sucks, it's just random ""bombing"" sounds that hardly fit in the movie. You can tell it's not Hans Zimmer. Second, it is an extremely confusing movie. It's as if the director had a million different ideas and just mixed them up together in a disorganized, completely random way. The timeline of the scenes is very random and hard to follow. Also, 3 hours was too long and after 2h I was bored. I feel like I just threw away 3h of my life. This movie is a very boring, confusing and soulless mess. I felt no emotion whatsoever from the movie, unlike with Nolan's other works. I wish it was more organized and concise.",Oppenheimer
6.0,Wrong focus and unnecessary non linear story telling,MCUFan-53154,21 July 2023,"I had high expectations but was disappointed. The performances are good.But the story becomes too much about him and not about the Manhattan project.The non linear story telling really spoils the rhythm and tempo of the Manhattan project.The story of the project itself is more interesting but it has gotten sidelined.In a sense Nolan tries so hard to keep you at the edge of your seat, by all the non linear story, you actually feel bored. Yes the movie drags!It really depends on what you want from the movie.Do you want a straightforward narrative that explains the chronology and challenges of the Manhattan project? Or do you care more about the thoughts and concerns and emotional issues and values and tribulations of Oppy with some of the chronology and issues of the project thrown in?I would have liked the former. Hence I feel ""Fat man and little boy"" starring Paul Newman is a more interesting story. That story focuses on the project and also the various characters associated with the project. Though even in that movie Oppy has a central role, the project really is the centerpiece. Here the project does not get as much of the focus it deserves.It leaves you wanting.",Oppenheimer
2.0,A serious take,verycherryrain,23 July 2023,"So my niece (12), sister (48) and I (male) watch the movie. Niece like it majority of the time for the colors and Barbie of course. My sister and I? We loathed it. My sister disliked it she missed that this was a PG-13 and being a mother hated the fact that she seen multiple kids under 12 some as young as 4 seeing this as they had multiple adult jokes and said parts of the body that kids shouldn't know yet until they are about teenagers. So warning for any parent it is PG-13. She and I also dislike the fact that whole ""storyline"" was about Barbie sad that she is flatfoot and has cellulite which everyone made fun of her and feel bad she was upset that girls whom are becoming of age shouldn't be showing that beauty has strong emphasis on everything. It was bland if you actually watch the movies and ignore political or social problems we have the story is so weak. Only actual part is when Ken actually tried to change a bit to stand out other then that it was basically everyone say i am ugly and I need to figure out I am not to make me feel better by showing everyone I am not ugly. Ending, and this is hot take, in both my sister's and my mind thought they were trying to say that women's greats gift or happiness is to take care of their daughter or just raise kids so we walk out of the movie hating it and thinking that they straight up made fun of both males and females males being show as idiotic meatheads and woman as I need to be accepted as beautiful and have kids to take care of. Their are way better movies that show empowerment if that what you seek. This just fails in everything well mostly everything music was okmand cast was great but overall just had themes they missed the mark on hard and story was just awful.

It pokes fun at the way society is but does it in a way that makes you really think about how you are living in this world. It has also made me decide to add more color into my everyday life as well!

4.0,Didn't meet my expectations,olelmao,21 July 2023,"I wanted to love this movie but it just wasn't it :(It was nothing that hasn't been done before. It didn't really say anything. I hate using the word woke, but hearing the same talking points is tiring. We understand, the patriarchy is bad. But I didn't go to this movie to be preached to.I was hoping it would be a bit more camp. I was expecting it to be like the Barbie animated films you get, which ngl, are usually good. This was far from that.The ending was also a bit dragged out. It was trying very hard to be profound and it wasn't working.I didn't care for any of the characters much either and was a little sad to not see Raquelle or any of Barbie's sisters apart from Skipper.Apart from the criticism, I thought the costume design was really well executed. Margot Robbie looked fabulous at all times.",Barbie
10.0,Is it on Top 3 films by Nolan?,oscarg18,20 July 2023,"With Oppenheimer, Nolan has created the perfect cinematic cocktail. Outstanding soundtrack, photography, actors and script, all these things that make up the cocktail are worth an Oscar. The performance of each of the actors is impressive, they all create a perfect tune that catches you in the plot. Expectations were extremely high with Cillian Murphy's performance, however he has been able to far exceed them with a superb performance. I have rarely seen an actor interpreting a historical character in such a deep way, in which for a moment you forget that it is Cillian and you really think that you are seeing Oppenheimer on the big screen. This gives a great added value to the film. In my opinion, Oppenheimer falls into Nolan's top 3 films, ranking it in the first place would be somewhat pretentious having only seen it once. Without any doubt in the following weeks I will return to the cinema to see this masterpiece again.",Oppenheimer

4.0,Boring with heavy political messaging,alarsen-80769,22 July 2023,"Wow, this was really bad. Here is the truth. It's boring. Plus, who wants to here about the patriarchy for 2hrs. Yes, the word patriarchy is said like 100 times. It's crazy. This was so heavy handed I don't even get why woman would like it....ithis should be fun, not some political statement. Let me tell you, the only fun was in the first 30 mins. Nobody, and I mean Nobody was laughing. The plot is all over the place and kind of surprising from the actual writer, which has done some great work in the past. Just makes me wonder if she was forced to push all this political stuff by corporate or she actually believes this nonsense. I thought Barbie would just be a fun goofy movie. But to be preached for 2 hours????? What the hell. I'm telling you most people will not like this movie, unless you're far far left.",Barbie
4.0,The other side of the Coin,tjerkotten-694-998156,21 July 2023,"I am a Christopher Nolan fan, particularly drawn to his original works. Biography and real-life storytelling also intrigue me, which is why I'm quite familiar with the Oppenheimer story. Based on the trailers, I believed this movie would delve into the science of bomb-making and explore Oppenheimer's emotions. In an interview, Nolan himself stated that the movie revolves around Oppenheimer, with the supporting cast merely there to complement the main character.With this expectation, I was hoping to witness Oppenheimer's inner struggles portrayed in a way that was far more personal. My desire was to experience the movie through Oppenheimer's perspective. Unfortunately, the film took a different approach, focusing more on the outside world's perception of Oppenheimer and the political entanglements, which I found to be the least interesting part of his story. Such aspects would be better suited for an actual documentary where facts and information are sought. In cinema, we crave thrilling experiences.Many have praised the film's non-CGI effects, but personally, I found the actual Trinity bomb explosion effect to be underwhelming. A movie about the atomic bomb should evoke a sense of suspense and offer the most impactful portrayal of its consequences, not just for spectacle but to evoke a deep emotional impact.As a graphic designer and animator familiar with practical effects, I can usually distinguish between CGI and practical effects. However, the close-ups of this non-CGI explosion did not thrill me.After seeing the movie, I couldn't help but wonder why it didn't take a direction more akin to 'The Imitation Game.' I yearned for a focus on the science behind creating the device and the emotional struggles that accompanied it.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Masterpiece,pusparajadhikari-80699,23 July 2023,"This has to be greatest movie of this decade. Stunning background music, acting and cinemetography makes this movie hook this audience even for three hours. Also the movie just don't only revolve around the making of atomic bomb but also contains the court drama after math where Robert J. Oppenheimer will be accused of being connected with communist party. This movie also showcase the political view and some glimpse of Oppenheimer's college life. But the most importantly this movie display the regret of Oppenheimer aftermath. Cillian Murphy had nailed in his character with his emotions and also the support cast has done their job brilliantly.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Fantastic movie!!!,marcecclefield,23 July 2023,"Barbie was a great film. This movie is so well written and super clever. Makes you laugh, cry, and ponder what it means to live in today's world.This film has a message for us all and makes some excellent philosophical points that will leave you thinking when the credits roll. It's that kind of movie. I was very pleasantly surprised to see that this movie didn't go the cartoony, campy direction. It so easily could have. But it went a much more thoughtful and clever way than I ever would've anticipated. I predict this movie becoming a classic, totally quotable movie, for years to come. Most of all I enjoyed myself at the movies again.",Barbie
10.0,Exemplary Movie,javed1703,21 July 2023,"Oppenheimer, could be, one of the best biographical movie ever existed. It does have a lot of ""heavy"" conversations but man, it leaves a strong impression and it is so compelling that made me speechless.Star-studded cast was not just for nothing, they truly, truly delivers each character perfectly. Especially Cillian, damn, brilliant performance. I truly wish that I could watch it in IMAX 70mm, the way they originally filmed it with.It is three hours long but I highly recommend you guys to watch Oppenheimer in the best theatre you could find in your city. Yes its gonna be boring if you're just accompanying your friend or S/O without actually intended to invest your time in this.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Oppenheimer stands out as one of the decade's most captivating films and serves as a reminder that cinema is an endeavor that requires hard work and perseverance.,Fineapplespov,24 July 2023,"This film is heavily dominated by dialogues. If you are a fan of action-packed films, you might find it boring. Although the film revolves around the topic of an atomic bomb, don't expect to see numerous explosions throughout the movie. Instead, it focuses not on the scientific formation of an atomic bomb, although there are some theories explained briefly, but on detailing the journey of Oppenheimer with his ideas, knowledge, strategies, and all the complexities he faced in creating the atomic bomb, which was ultimately used on Japan.This film is expensive and high-class, destined for the Oscars without a doubt. It features a star-studded cast, even the minor roles (despite having little screentime) are portrayed by familiar faces. It's incredible, really.To this day, I just can't stop thinking about the Trinity scene. That's the pinnacle of the film, the moment when my breath was held, and my eyes were glued to the screen. It's remarkable how Nolan manages to make this scene so intense and chilling. Presented with impeccable visuals, music, and acting that needs no doubt, I am truly impressed with this film. The ending was nothing short of a masterpiece that left me with a deep sense of emotion.Surprisingly, this is one of the few Nolan films that I could still understand without being perplexed (apart from its scientific theories). I wish I had a better grasp of the science behind the atomic bomb in this film so that I could give it a rating of 10/10.Thank you Mr. Nolan and Mr. Cillian, you have once again reminded me of the beauty of the cinematic world.-@fineapplespov.",Oppenheimer
2.0,Poor biography. Not wort watching. Much hyped,basuchandaki,23 July 2023,"Oppenheimer is 80% of interrogation between opphenhimer and Lewis Strauss assembled people to check opphenhimer loyalty to America. It's 10% of Trinity test and 10% some glims of Manhattan project. So it's a crap out of it. Don't watch it in theater , wait and watch in ott. Oppenheimer is much hyped crap. Even though the subject in public domain Nolan not delevared a good script. It's another fail movie from him.It's 3 hour move. Only half an hour can watch. I m fully West desspointed after watching it. It's waste of 100 million dollars cost. He did crap this time. Nolan will remember this failure.",Oppenheimer
6.0,Genric Biography Movie,fahad_b,20 July 2023,"If you like biography movies, you gonna enjoy it even though it's a bit long & suddenly gets complicated for no reason other than it's a Nolan movie so it has to be.. One thing I'm sure about is that Oppenheimer will win the Oscar for any sound related Awards.. The visual side of the movie is great and you can tell it's a Nolan movie, so if that's something you like you gonna enjoy it.. For the casting I think Cillian Murphy did a fantastic job he wasn't over the top as some other actors in a biography movies, although she didn't have much screen time Florence Pugh as usual proves to world that she is be the best actress right now..",Oppenheimer
10.0,What Walt's Watching,waltermwilliams,21 July 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" or ""How the Father of the Atomic Bomb learned to start worrying and Hate the Bomb""In this story of American scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer it's not just about his role in the development of the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, New Mexico, but also the machiavellian manoeuvres going on to discredit him in the United States.The downfall of Oppenheimer is the main thrust of this story arc, long after he helped his government build the A Bombs that landed on Hiroshima and Nagasaki killing thousands of innocent civilians to end World War 2 even though Adolph Hitler was already dead and the Germans had surrendered.""Oppenheimer"" is the most promising and prominent Oscar bait so far of 2023 for Best Picture, Screenplay, Sound Engineering, Actor, Supporting Actor etc.If this doesn't sweep the floor then I don't know what will.Cillian Murphy is outstanding, Robert Downey Jr. Unrecognisable at first and gives a very different performance.It's almost like he's channeling F. Murray Abraham (""Amadeus"") and ""My Left Foot"" star Daniel Day Lewis.In fact, the way this film plays out reminded me of the genius of ""Amadeus"".This is one of the most impressive uses of an all-star cast I've ever seen.More often than not the higher the star count the lesser the movie, but director Christopher Nolan (""Dark Knight"") manages to herd his cattle even better than Alfred Hitchcock.I'm talking about Matt Damon, Florence Pugh, Kenneth Branagh, Gary Oldman, Emily Blunt, Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck, Matthew Modine, Rami Malek & Aussie Jason Clarke to name a few.These actors transformed themselves for their roles superbly.The only actor noticeably absent from this ensemble was Michael Caine who's been in many Nolan movies.Somehow no CGI was harmed in the making of this movie...none at all, despite the awesome Visual SFX.It's not the first time Murphy & Nolan have worked, it's their sixth collaboration, but it is Cillians first time as the lead in one of Christopher's movies as the American theoretical physicist and Project Director of The Manhattan Project to create the first nuclear weapons of mass destruction.Plus I tips me hat to composer Ludwig Gorannson for his score, which takes this movie to another level.Special shout out also to cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema who worked with Nolan on ""Interstellar"", ""Dunkirk"" and ""Tenet"".""Oppenheimer"" is based on the biographical book ""American Prometheus"" and when Nolan saw the cover art on the book he could only see Murphy in this titular role.Warning: Nudity & Sex scenes (in a movie about scientist nerds...I know right!) After sitting through 3 intense hours of what could have been dry fodder in the hands of lesser people (it's very wordy dialogue centric so please pay attention) I can understand why ""Oppenheimer"" was one of the most anticipated movies of the year.I saw this in The Lounge/Gold Class so I can't begin to imagine how mind blowing ""Oppenheimer"" will look and sound in its intended IMAX format and for the first time ever Kodak invented Black and White IMAX film just for this movie.This is possibly the best, most important movie ever given the rumblings of war mongering in the world today.As J. Robert Oppenheimer states in this movie, ""I don't know if we can be trusted with such a weapon. But I know the Nazis can't."" This could possibly be Director Christopher Nolans Magnum Opus!",Oppenheimer
10.0,A spectacular achievement from Nolan!,danhvannguyen,29 July 2023,"Wow, what a monumental & sensational film! Nolan reinvents the three-Act structure to extraordinary effect. Oppenheimer is an intense and thrilling film that grabs a hold of your attention from the first frame and never let's you go. A mesmerising and powerful drama that unfolds like a thriller; Nolan builds the tension to a breathtaking climax, but thereafter does not let go, when it morphs into a thrilling and tense courtroom drama. The performances are all uniformly incredible, but Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Junior, Emily Blunt and Jason Clarke are the clear standouts. Every performance is a fully realised characterisation. Nolan has crafted a masterful film with the highest technical achievement, from the cinematography, to the production design, to the film's epic and haunting score from Ludwig Gorranson. This is Nolan's masterpiece!",Oppenheimer

Make sure to visit bathroom and take snacks to this 3 hours incredible experience that you feel that time just flies. Drink a lot of water after. Remember to watch in on 70mm screen.",Oppenheimer
6.0,Almost Walked Out,jmillerjr-00983,24 July 2023,"The love for this movie is very perplexing. I keep reading words like ""masterpiece"" to describe it and I just don't see it. What I saw was a disjointed mess! No character development and very poor story telling. I suppose its erratic quality was intentional on the part or the director (perhaps to help us into the mind of Oppenheimer), but it most certainly didn't land for me. I checked the clock a lot. Had I been watching it on streaming, I'd probably have turned it off after the first 30 minutes or so.A lot of folks seemed to have problems with the sex scenes, saying they didn't add to the movie. I actually disagree. I felt the sex scenes stressed Oppenheimer's immature attitude toward women and really his general attitude towards others. I suppose this could have been accomplished without nudity, but I thought the sex scenes made sense in the context of an otherwise confusing narrative.I suppose the acting was decent, but the script was so boring it gave the actors little to work with. It felt so emotionless and lifeless to me. Most of Nolan's work feels that way to me. Even Murphey seemed bored by the role and not always sure of the character he was playing. Emily Blunt had that pointed scene towards the end, but for the most part, I was unsure of her character and her place in the film. I'd have been curious to see this same story told by Aaron Sorkin or Ron Howard or Wolfgang Peterson. Bottom line - snore. In fact I think I did doze off a few times.",Oppenheimer
7.0,Politics Of The Bomb,redcanofevil,21 July 2023,"Might sound absolutely blasphemous but I think this is better watched at home. This is not against the quality of the filmmaking, which was understandably amazing but the tediousness of it being an unintentional Oscar bait. There are tooo many characters, most looking similar and too dialogue heavy to be watching in theatres. The soundmixing leaves a lot of the dialogue to the imagination as well. What I expected from it was not what I walked away with, this is not about the bomb rather than the political side of the bomb. So be prepared to sit through endless courtroom back-and-forth with characters introduced in almost every scene. If you are not already aware of exactly what happened to Oppenheimer esp his life after the bomb, you're gonna have a really hard time understanding whats going on. Thats where the paradox lies, can it be a masterfully crafted movie if you lose your audience before the credits? Because it absolutely is and most around me absolutely were. And then if you are already aware of everything that happened to Oppenheimer was it really necessary to play the plot twist game with a certain character throughout the entire movie? The whole movie was a bit of oxymoron, you get to see what you prolly didnt want to and didnt get to see what you most wanted to. I'm talking about the bomb obviously, I was heavily disappointed by the absence of it. The saving grace was the amazing acting performance by RDJ and Emily Blunt who both should be receiving Oscar nominations. Cillian Murphy did a great job as well but there were many scenes where I felt like I was watching Tommy Shelby instead of Robert Oppenheimer. The best part of watching Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer was when he had no dialogues because his eyes do a better job at portraying what Nolan was going for. There is surprisingly little of the Nolan ""practical effect mindbending scene that needs to be seen in cinemas"". This was easier to follow and harder to watch than TENET.RATING: 7.5/10.",Oppenheimer
9.0,"Oppenheimer is, quite literally, a bomb.",catooooo,24 July 2023,"With a duration of 180 minutes, we are granted the virtue of witnessing a masterful representation of how the human being can set aside their own humanity when obstinately clinging to their ideals. It is truly admirable how the film delves deeply into moral themes and how its messages impact and move the audience, leaving an indelible imprint on the human psyche. The unique narrative of this film far surpasses any other production based on historical events, even if the latter may not be rigorously precise. However, it is precisely in this imprecision where its charm lies, for the film does not seek to be a mere documentary; rather, it is an emotional and profound portrayal of a range of feelings experienced by the protagonist throughout the film, including guilt, resilience, anguish, and many others.Accompanied by a masterful soundtrack, the film stands out for its raw and evocative scenes that immerse the viewer in a palpable silence, creating an almost eerie intrigue. Even if the audience might lack knowledge in the scientific terms addressed by the film, it is astonishing how Nolan manages to construct such a complex plot centered around the creation of the atomic bomb and its consequences, while remaining accessible and comprehensible. This achievement is an undeniable asset, considering that some directors deliberately aim to complicate their works in pursuit of a perceived quality, whereas here, an extraordinary balance is struck between depth and narrative clarity.Moreover, it is delightful to observe the meticulous approach taken in addressing the inherent problems associated with the potential catastrophe that an atomic bomb could unleash upon our planet. Literally, the film portrays the devastating impacts of such a disaster, while conceptually, as the plot unfolds, various meanings underlying the concept are interpreted.Another outstanding aspect lies in how the film refrains from presenting an absolute idea regarding religion or beliefs prevailing within its context. Although the word ""communism"" is frequently mentioned, the film refrains from imposing the notion that this movement holds an absolute truth, a common occurrence in numerous instances. Furthermore, the absence of computer-generated effects (CGI) in favor of a classic cinematic style enhances the film's audiovisual spectacle, heightened by the visual impact of brilliantly executed black and white scenes. It is truly gratifying to appreciate this seventh art form in its pure essence through these sequences.Without further ado, it is worth noting Cillian Murphy's remarkable performance, which stands as one of the finest in its genre. Therefore, I wholeheartedly recommend the complete viewing of ""Oppenheimer,"" a cinematic masterpiece that undoubtedly deserves to be experienced in a theater to fully appreciate its exquisite audiovisual effects.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Not At All What I Expected,danils-96966,22 July 2023,"My girlfriend and I went to see this movie last night on the day of release because she was so excited for it. Going into it, I had my doubts... I was pleasantly surprised.The attention to detail was truly amazing, the colourful Barbie World, the way the dolls moved and interacted with objects, the references to less popular and discontinued Barbie dolls.I thought that the comedy in the movie was going to be completely cringe worthy. However, the movie was actually funny. There was not any point that I felt that they were trying too hard to make the movie funny or anything like that. There was just the right amount of humour for a movie like this.The adult humour was a bit of fun too, fair to say that I did get a good amount of laughs whilst watching.Allan (one of the discontinued Barbie Doll models) was my favourite character throughout the movie. Though his role was fairly small and he was there for a bit of comic relief, he was funny and also somewhat relatable.I appreciate that this movie is not for everyone, that being said, I do think that there will be many mixed reviews about this movie.I for one have nothing bad to say about the movie, my girl and I thoroughly enjoyed it, so much so that she walked out of that movie much happier than when we walked in.",Barbie

7.0,brilliant casting but should have been a mini series,fossillurker,26 July 2023,"The acting of the cast was brilliant but it would have been better as a mini series which would have allowed for an exploration of topics that just have been glossed over in the movie. The timeline of events felt rushed, the psychological state of Oppenheimer and his questions about morality just scratched the surface. His relationships to e.g. The women in his life and brother were not further explored. Thus, the portrayal of Oppenheimer is stuck in a weird place between a one and three-dimensional character. A mini series would have added much more depth to an interesting, conflicted man as well as the historical context and events.",Oppenheimer
9.0,superior filmmaking and historical storytelling,ferguson-6,22 July 2023,"Greetings again from the darkness. As pupils slouched in our school desks during history class, we easily and naturally disassociated with the many stories of war. World War II was lumped in with WWI, the Civil War, and The Revolutionary War. There were names and dates to memorize for quizzes and final exams, yet even with relatives recounting stories of kin, a personal connection was rare. As we aged and experienced modern-day warfare, the personal connection became all too real. Reality struck that soldiers are human beings with families, and despite their missions and marching orders, most are as innocent as the 'tragic civilian casualties' reported on the newswires. Along these lines, an aspect of war that has often remained overlooked is the behind-closed-doors decision-making of politicians and military leaders. Filmmaker-extraordinaire Christopher Nolan takes us behind those doors through the eyes of J Robert Oppenheimer, the Father of the Atomic Bomb. What we see is quite frightening.Prepare yourself. At a full three hours in length, Nolan's film is a hefty undertaking for viewers. It demands full focus and attention to details and nuance, as you spend significant time listening to brilliant men talk amongst themselves. Nolan adapted the screenplay from the 2005 biography, ""American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J Robert Oppenheimer"", written by Kai Bird and Martin Sherman. The end result is a film centered on complex physics and mathematics, yet presented in a simplified manner such that it's much more a character study than a science class. The key is what characters say to each other, how they say it, and how they debate and rationalize the morality of the objective ... building a bomb designed to kill people.The morality of The Manhattan Project is under the microscope here, as is the motivation and concern of Oppenheimer. We get some early background establishing him as an upcoming mind in the world of physics from his academic stops around the globe. Some know Cillian Murphy from ""Peaky Blinders"" or as Scarecrow in Nolan's Batman movies. I'd also recommend a couple of Murphy's underrated gems: FREE FIRE (2016) and RED EYE (2005). It's hard to overstate how spot on Murphy is as Oppenheimer. He lost weight for the role and captures the distinctive movements and speech patterns, as well as the familiar poses and deep-in-thought eyes. We never once question whether this is Oppenheimer, the leader of the science team at the Los Alamos Lab and the Father of the Atomic bomb ... the one who ""sees beyond the world we live in."" Once Major Groves (Oscar winner Matt Damon) recruits Oppenheimer to run and assemble the great scientific minds, the obvious question to those involved is ... even if we can create this bomb, should we do it? This weighs heavily on Oppenheimer - a man so engulfed by science that his haunting visions are that of atoms and particles and experimental reactions (perhaps a bit too heavy in the first act). Groves is the military leader of the project and the liaison between the scientists, the military, and the government. It's also clear that while Oppenheimer's brilliance is recognized and necessary to the project, almost no one outside of the scientists trusts him. This is where antisemitism and fears of communism arise. Oppenheimer was Jewish and, though he never joined the communist party, was associated with many who did. This included his love interest, Psychiatrist Jean Tatlock (the fabulous rising star Florence Pugh), his wife Kitty (Emily Blunt), and his brother Frank (Dylan Arnold).The teamwork and stress involved with building the bomb in Los Alamos is conveyed as rooms full of brilliant minds determine the future path of the country and the world. This culminates in the stunning sequence of The Trinity Test near Alamogordo. A blending of complete silence, along with spectacular sound and light, is truly a technical highlight of the film. The initial celebration of success initially overshadows the true meaning ... the bomb is now ready for Hiroshima and Nagasaki, killing two hundred thousand people and essentially ending WWII, less than four years after the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese (never mentioned here).The bombings are heard via radio news reports, and it's at this point where the weight of what the scientists have done is fully realized. Oppenheimer became a national hero and his Time Magazine cover proves it. A meeting with President Harry S Truman (Oscar winner Gary Oldman sporting a Missouri accent) doesn't go well, as Oppenheimer is introduced to political gamesmanship, something he would face even more directly in the near future. Lewis Strauss (Oscar winner Robert Downey Jr) is a key player as chairman of the US Atomic Energy Commission, and through him, we witness ego, ambition, and petty behavior that leads to a level of vindictiveness typically only seen at the junior high level.Multiple timelines are covered. There is the background information on Oppenheimer's early years, his well-rounded academia, his love life (lives), his building of the Los Alamos lab team, the overseeing of the bomb development, his time as a hero, the later backroom kangaroo court designed to disgrace him, and Strauss' Senate Confirmation hearing for Secretary of Commerce. All of these tie together, and it's those final two that make up the last act of the film - giving us a taste of just how nasty politics was 70 years ago (not unlike these days).Nolan has assembled a deep cast with numerous Oscar winners and a roster of talented actors. Among the familiar faces not already named above are: Oscar winner Kenneth Branagh as Danish Physicist Neils Bohr, Oscar winner Rami Malek as experimental physicist David Hill, Oscar winner Casey Affleck as Military security advisor Boris Pash, Tom Conti as Albert Einstein, Benny Safdie, Dane DeHaan, Jason Clarke, Josh Hartnett, David Krumholtz, Matthew Modine, Alden Ehrenreich, Scott Grimes, Tony Goldwyn, James D'Arcy, James Urbaniak, Olivia Thirlby, James Remar, and (Nolan regular) David Dastmalchian.The film is a historical biopic and also an unconventional thriller. Is this about unparalleled advancement in science or is it about the moral dilemma of mass destruction and death? Politics, military, ego, power, science, love, revenge, and redemption are all displayed as Oppenheimer struggles with the power he has created and the lack of power in how it's used. My favorite line in the film is aimed at Oppenheimer when someone informs him that he's now ""not just self-important, but actually important."" The stakes are clear during the test when it's stated that there is a ""near zero"" chance of destroying the world.Cillian Murphy is a shoe-in for a Best Actor nomination, and his performance mesmerizes us. It's nice to see Robert Downey Jr remind us of his true talent, and he should be rewarded with a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Florence Pugh and Emily Blunt, in the only two substantive women roles, should both receive consideration as well. Pugh's role is limited but memorable, while Blunt shines in her best scene during the security hearing.Christopher Nolan has delivered near perfection in technical movie-making, and on top of that, the story and characters are real life, and the performances are top notch. His use of Black & White film for Strauss' perspective allows the viewer to differentiate the Oppenheimer viewpoint. Impressively, while there are some visual effects, Nolan has stated that no CGI was used in the film, and that's most evident in the relatively short closing credit roll - where we typically get dozens if not hundreds of technical experts listed. Ludwig Goransson's (Oscar winner for BLACK PANTHER) score packs an emotional punch, and Jennifer Lame's editing is excellent and vital. Lastly, cinematographer (and regular Nolan collaborator) Hoyte Van Hoytema drives home the power of smart men in a room, as well as the devastation of the bomb test. This is excellent filmmaking and a reminder that the only thing we love more than lifting new heroes onto the pedestal of worship is tearing down those same heroes with a dose of humility. These types of movies rarely get produced these days, so here's hoping enough people go back to the theater to see it to inspire more filmmakers to take a shot.Opened nationally July 21, 2023.",Oppenheimer
10.0,So fun!,jdjerika,23 July 2023,A fantastic fun summer movie! Barbie is not at all What I thought it would be. We laughed through the entire movie. Margot Robbie is absolutely perfect as well as America Ferrera. Ryan Gosling plays ken so well with a great twist. The movie had a lot of laughs along with an amazing message. It's hard to be a women and Barbie really shares a perspective that I think most women feel everyday. This is an important show for both females and males to see. I went into the movie with no expectations and came out thrilled and wanting to see it again. I've seen a lot of film this summer and this was my favorite so far!,Barbie
5.0,An unpopular opinion from a die-hard Nolan fan,FeastMode,21 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan is my favorite director of all time. He has four of my top six movies, eight of my top twenty. It's absurd how much joy he's given me. I consider him, to the full extent of the word, a genius.Let me start by saying this is an objectively good movie. The technical aspects are all up to the Nolan standards. The acting is fantastic from a ridiculous cast. The ones that stood out to me the most are the always amazing Emily Blunt and the soon-to-be Oscar winner (hopefully) Downy Jr.Subjectively... I hate to say it but I found it boring. And it's not because it's too long. I think a movie should be as long as it needs to be and hate when studios mess with the art to achieve shorter runtimes. The reason I was bored is because I was fairly uninterested and not invested. It did not evoke emotions, something Nolan normally does better than anyone. I even checked the time at one point, something I never imagined I'd say about a Nolan movie.While it was still a treat to see this in IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio, there isn't anything that wowed me aside from one scene. Part of why I love Nolan movies is that feeling of awe from witnessing something on screen that I've never seen before or could possibly imagine. Not the case here.This isn't a criticism because the musical score is really good and works for the movie. But I'm begging Nolan to reunite with Hans Zimmer. No one is on his level. The musical scores for Inception, Interstellar and The Dark Knight trilogy are iconic. They are stuck in your head on the way home. You add them to your playlist and listen to them repeatedly, even a decade later. Everyone will recognize the music from those movies, even if they haven't seen it in years. Again, not the case here.I want to emphasize that this is my subjective opinion. I don't normally go for historical/biographical movies. Part of the reason sci-fi is my favorite genre is because of its limitless possibilities. A movie based in reality is much more limited but can still be really creative if it's fiction (like Memento and Following). But a biographical film about real events is extremely limited and lacks the beauty of the unknown. Dunkirk at least made up for it with amazing action scenes.If you enjoy historical movies, you will probably love this like everyone else. For me, it felt like a really well-made movie we'd watch in history class on movie day. I'm endlessly sad that I have to wait another three years for a new Nolan movie, and hope that he switches back to something more intriguing than the life of a scientist.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 7/20/2023)",Oppenheimer
6.0,A bit underwhelming...,laurentnroussel,24 July 2023,"On the + side: Good cinematography Good acting (especially Robert Downey Jr) Interesting story (quite reminiscent of the Alan Turing story)On the - side: Dialog heavy Annoying music almost non stop.

Didn't really feel the sheer devastating power of the bomb I had hoped I would actually lean more on how they came up with building an A bomb Felt long...All in all, quite disappointed and although beautifully shot, I never felt it deserved the 70mm treatment (especially since a good portion of the movie is set in meeting rooms or court rooms) and all the marketing around recreating the explosion. The original footage is actually more scary!",Oppenheimer
10.0,cillian murphy isn't human,mohaedashraf,20 July 2023,"Cillian Murphy was not an ordinary actor, he was a robot controlled by Chris to show the performance and personality in this way. At a moment I felt that this is the life of the real Cillian Murphy and not acting. I expect the Oscars to be settled for Killian. To be the highest rated movie in history. The film's shortcomings are few, including the way in narrating the events that is not considered a defect, because Chris liked to move between the past, present and future frequently. In the end, some people may not like this type of film, and this is normal, but I think that they are less than affecting such creativity. If you want a sentence to describe the movie (creativity at its best)",Oppenheimer
8.0,Brilliant and fascinating !,trevor_alex,21 July 2023,"To kick things off ! I have to say the visuals and the storyline was very well combined ! I was very well impressed with some of the performances and in particular Emily Blunt Cillian Murphy and most importantly the support actors who had their moment to shine through this movie.They were moments were you feel like it's going to explode but left with an open ended line wondering what's next ! Nevertheless, it was encouraging to see Nolan putting a factual output of Oppenheimer's character and bringing the audience into the shoes of the character. Despite this,the last hour really dragged a bit longer than it should of been but can't take way another masterclass from Nolan !!",Oppenheimer
5.0,Wish I could get these 3 hours of my life back,fbbjtryk,23 July 2023,"I'm a movie buff. I love quality storytelling and Character development. This movie had none of these qualities. It was laden with music & sounds that were way too loud and completely distracting. Even to the point where, when you wanted to care about a character, you couldn't because the constant noise distracts. The acting and cinematography was good but if you don't know the story of Oppenheimer you will not understand. I recommend watching a biography of his life first so you can get a sense of what happened. This movie only touches on what actually happened. It's more of a courtroom drama..",Oppenheimer
8.0,Unexpected well done societal criticism,rubenkaandorp,22 July 2023,"Was walking into this movie expecting a light-harder fun movie about Barbie and Ken, but left questioning the systemic inequality in our society. What many men will tell you is that this movie is just another woke feminist movie, but I highly encourage everyone to go watch Barbie to truly understand how women feel in todays world. Furthermore the production of the movie was greath. Everything from the cast, the plot, the pacing, the acting, the cinematography and ending was well done. I already know this movie is gonna cause lots of polarisation, but I would recommend everyone to watch this movie and come to their own conclusions.",Barbie
6.0,Mediocrity at its best,teavrdoljak-82913,28 July 2023,"I have to admit I'm not the biggest Nolan fan, so my expectations for this movie weren't high. Nevertheless, it was even worse then I expected. By worse, I don't mean unwatchable, but boring and average af. The dialogue is so crushingly pathetic, shallow, even cringe at moments, it feels like AI wrote it. Visually, there's nothing new, you won't be mind-blowed, which is perfectly fine, but that leaves us with.... nothing to write home about. I came to a conclusion that it would perhaps be better if Nolan solely directed his movies and left writing to others, as it really isn't his strength. This is not movie-related but I'll write it anyway because I can: it would be really nice if directors like Nolan who have a huge fan base and are capable of making good and fresh movies (which I think he is, see: Following) would really do that instead of a vanilla movie made to please everyone and therefore offering nothing of substance. There aren't many people with that kind of reach and I assume liberty/funds to do what they want, so I guess my point is that in a perfect world it would be a moral obligation to use that power to move boundaries and broaden our horizons. This is of course not a direct attack on Nolan, maybe the guy really is restricted by the industry and not allowed to do witty and meaningful movies, who knows. I only wish there were more artist showing the middle finger to the Hollywood studios and insisting on doing their thing (David Lynch I love you)",Oppenheimer
7.0,"A great deal of fun, and kinda profound too",greenariansoon,24 July 2023,"This movie was just so fun to watch. I'm not personally a fan of barbie, never really played with them or interacted with the IP in anyway, but just the pure outlandish absurdity of this movie and the over-the-top acting... I couldn't stop laughing throughout most of the runtime.Based on how the movie was marketed, I was 100% expecting to be pondering the question, ""what does it mean to exist?"" by the end. Well, the movie pondered the question, came to a conclusion, and then told me what that conclusion was in a way that was very clear and easy to understand. Personally, I like when a movie isn't exactly clear. I like when I have to dig a little, think about it, discuss it with other people. With Barbie, I felt no need for that. The message was crystal clear. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing, but it was just a little too on the nose for my taste.All in all, a super fun watch. I saw this with my family. We bought popcorn, milkshakes, and it was a great time.",Barbie
6.0,The clash of the decade,zebthered,26 July 2023,"Barbie vs Oppenheimer, was an amazing event to take place, if you want to say they were even going against each other, it was very enjoyable to see this take place though.But as for Barbie the movie was okay in my opinion, it was no doubt hilarious and joyful, I would probably rewatch it for that reason. But the movie itself just kind of lacked something, I think the story was okay, had some good messages. Some parts just didn't work well, the storyline of the daughter didn't make sense, because one scene she's mean and terrible then all of the sudden she's nice, just didn't work that well.But overall it was just okay, probably won't watch it again.",Barbie

10.0,Better Than Typical Nolan Fare!,j_kurzyn,21 July 2023,"Not your typical Nolan pic but that's a good thing.Beautifully acted and shot. Fantastically expansive and engaging. Saw it in IMAX though it was not necessary. Wonderfully cinematic score. Love the use of percussion.Highly recommended for history, cinephiles, and Nolan fans. I predict accolades all around and if this doesn't sweep awards season I would be SHOCKED.Fun fact, no CGI. Everything is practical affects. The film is long (3 hours) so choose your breaks in the first hour.Wonderfully surprised by the political story as well. I had no idea. Nolan did a great job of making him human and not judging.",Oppenheimer
4.0,The glorification of misandry.,TristanSilya,22 July 2023,"On the surface it's a fun and bubbly movie. Lots of cool colors, cool design, fun styles and music. Barbie world is pretty cool and makes you want to be a part of it. Unfortunately this isn't really a Barbie movie.In terms of accuracy they've changed a lot of things about Barbie and what Barbie is supposed to be about.When you dig a bit deeper (you actually don't have to dig at all if you're wise and have an eye for subliminal messages, social cues, and agendas) you quickly it's mainly a movie about misandry.Basically ""men are dumb and bad"" and ""women should pursue career"" and they wrapped the whole premise in a giant Barbie flashy skin. It's quite concerning how much damage this movie will actually do to our society because many impressionable kids and young adults will watch this and be influenced by it without even being aware of it.",Barbie
7.0,"Many Will Go, Most Will Enjoy",Sarah423,24 July 2023,"Having just watched a woman drag her tween daughter out of the movie, trailed along a bit after by a couple of older sorts, I can tell you this movie is not what some people have envisioned.It is not a light-hearted children's film. It is PG-13 for a reason and also if you haven't taught your daughter the word ""patriarchy"" yet, that might be something to cover first.Second, it's not a paean to the Barbie doll, Barbie collectors, or Mattel as a corporation. Honestly, I'm not sure how they're signed on as producers except perhaps to prove the point that the corporation is all about a cash grab.(The execs come across as buffoons and their talking points about being there for little girls are definitely shredded in the early encounters. No room to come back.)So while many went into the theater this weekend expecting a fun movie, not everyone will enjoy the show.---I personally thought it was ok--not as grand as expected, but I got to the end well enough.The acting was the fun part, especially Ryan Gosling as the air headed and thwarted Ken--voice of male fragility.Songs are catchy ear worms. The sets are marvelous pop art pink and scaled to make things look doll-like.The plot is a weak point, I'll admit, being very simplistic.Honestly, however, I kind of expected that. (So unlike the women above neither stomped nor snuck out.)Mainly the message is to crush the patriarchy (ok--but where is Allan's role in this patriarchy and why is a pregnant Midge so looked down on, even now?And since the ending sees Mattel theoretically still ramping production, what did we actually learn from this messaging anyhow?)If the pitch was to be a pivot to a modernized Barbie, I'm not sure that marketing campaign did any favors. And if it was that humanism is more important than corporate greed, the associated marketing merch kind of undercut the message, too.At any rate, the directoral easter eggs kept me going through all of it (call back cinematic opening is just the start) So there's good news and bad news, and maybe it's cost sunk fallacy making me give the film a seven. But I thought it was ""OK,"" so here we are.",Barbie
10.0,"Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' Transcends Cinematic Boundaries with a Captivating Blend of History, Science, and Emotion",mohd-zaid-k,22 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer' is a masterpiece that seamlessly weaves together historical events, scientific discoveries, and the complexities of human emotions.

10.0,Mind blowing,diemtzbello,25 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan does it again Oppenheimer has got to be one of the best three hours that I've experienced in 2023. I was really excited about this movie when it was announced and it did not disappoint, even though it is three hours long I feel like that's the adequate amount of time that it needs. Cillian Murphy's performance of the character is just beautifully done, he nailed it. I was also a big fan of the music used in the background throughout the movie. It's just amazing the scenery that it takes place it's beautiful. I like how they tease you with the atomic bomb throughout the movie until the final moment. Cillian Murphy definitely deserve an Oscar for his performance.",Oppenheimer
3.0,Boring and comical (not in a good way),williamjosecastillo,22 July 2023,"I wanted to like this movie but it was just plain silly. Maybe it's meant for pre-teens. I can't believe Margo and Ryan needed the money so bad they accepted these roles. Ive also noticed that Goslin puts way too much make up on and a lot of the shots are animated or touched up digitally to make him look younger. He is 43 yrars old. Thiwcis not the type of role for him. Hollywood really needs to step up when it comes to quality. Barbie movie??? I mean, that's just unnecessary. I can't believe some people here thought it was entertaining. Don't waste your hard earned money on this one. Avoid at all costs.",Barbie
6.0,Disturbingly downplaying the drama behing the nuclear weapon,marian-c-rotariu,23 July 2023,"The movie barely represents the Hiroshima and Nagasaki drama. Being at Hiroshima and visiting the museum I was shocked to see some depictions with the aftermath of such a horrendous act.Briefly showing the internal struggle in Oppenheimer's head regarding the morality of it and focusing more on the politics and on the romanticized meetings is unacceptable. For sure, Oppenheimer had nightmares about the bombs, but instead we are seeing some flashbacks and a carbonized body. That is it! Nothing else.Half of the movie is pointless, nobody cares about how Oppenheimer was discredited in the public for being a spy or that his clearance was dropped. Everybody cares about the horror of creating and using of such an absurdly overpowered weapon.",Oppenheimer
7.0,More focused on bureaucracy than fundamentals of physics,harshalpanchal,22 July 2023,I was very hyped about this movie but I'm somewhat disappointed. I found this movie more focused on the bureaucracy. It could have been more focused on the scientific part like the inventions of physics during this project. I also believe many important scientists who contributed in this project were not highlighted along with the research part for the test. Also this movie was not thought provoking much as compared to other Nolan movies. I cannot help it but comparing this movie with Parmanu movie of Bollywood and I found Parmanu more exciting than Oppenheimer. Felt like this was made in rush. Sorry.,Oppenheimer
10.0,Brilliant film that showcases womanhood perfectly,lizrgreene,23 July 2023,"Barbie blew my expectations away. I have never seen such a brilliantly written movie that makes me want to immediately rewatch. Every detail was thought of in Barbie's world and the satire of the Ken's and patriarchal society was hilarious and relatable as a woman. The dialogue was perfectly childish (as if children were playing with the barbie's speaking) and intelligent. America Ferrara's monologue about the hardships of being a woman was spot on and every woman in the theater could relate. The movie was fun and heartfelt while also drawing attention to society's imperfections. Men who say this film isn't good or ""anti-man"", is part of the problem.",Barbie

I never imagined that I would watch a biographical film with this much enjoyment, even though the film was long, It was three hours, but I did not feel it because it was fast and fun. Everything was great and it is considered an injustice if the movie got less than two Oscar. In the end, I want to say that Mr. Christopher Nolan presented us with a wonderful and unforgettable cinematic masterpiece, and every time he directs a movie, he raises the ceiling of challenges and makes things difficult for the rest of the directors.",Oppenheimer
10.0,"Biopic, history lesson and morality tale all in one, made by a megaton of talent",Field78,25 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan's movies are among the best ever made, be it his Dark Knight Trilogy, gritty and trope-challenging crime operas that happen to have superheroes in them, or his science-fiction movies like Inception and Interstellar, which are though-provoking, yet still with the required amusement factor for the blockbuster audience. His last sci-fi movie, Tenet, was as high concept as ever, but also complex to a fault, and somewhat lacking a heart to win over the big crowds. But even though every movie that Nolan makes is big, he tends to alternate between something more mainstream (for lack of a better term) and something that feels a bit smaller and more personal. And though it tackles big themes, few of his movies feel so personal as Oppenheimer.In the beginning, it may feel a bit confusing why Nolan keeps moving back and forth in time, but as soon as we are pulled into the narrative, it becomes clear that the emotional core is formed by Dr. Robert Oppenheimer being interrogated in a private hearing. It is the scaffolding for a series of flashbacks that illustrate the topics that are being discussed, from the doctor's beginnings as a promising but clumsy student, to the man who saved America, to an enemy of the state who had to be silenced for not walking in sync with the political climate at the time. At the surface, the movie is a re-telling of a decisive moment in human history, and it is easy to see why the parallels with today's situation makes it such a suitable subject: the ease with which allies can change into enemies; governments eagerly exploiting those with opposite ideas when they are needed, but disposing of them when they stop being useful; and people getting cancelled by labeling their views too liberal or socialist.On another level, Oppenheimer is also a biopic of a man who is brilliant yet also flawed, with many talents and an almost annoying lack of vanity. Apart from his brilliance, his biggest talent is eschewing his own ego by bringing other great minds together on the Manhattan project. He is also a womaniser who has trouble being a family man and a faithful husband, is sometimes too honest, and can step on the wrong toes, like those of his counterpart, Senator Strauss (Robert Downey Jr.). Cillian Murphy, Nolan's secret weapon in their sixth collaboration, is great as the man who understands the necessity of what he is inventing, yet is also realistic enough to know where he should stop. None of his shortcomings makes him in any way bad or unqualified, but those are grounds to be silenced even today, especially if one's political views can be easily taken out of context.Nolan skillfully films Oppenheimer's narrative in color, and switches to black-and-white when showing Strauss' side. Which brings us to the third layer within the movie, as a carefully crafted morality tale. For a seemingly simple story about a country at war with ruthless enemies, and scientists being asked to help invent a solution, the film shows that the science and decision-making was not driven by intellect, but more often than not frought with human shortcomings such as pride, resentment, egoism, desires and revulsion. The great thing is that both sides of the drama get ample time and exposure, so that we see why these people do what they did, with the judgment left to the viewer. We are drawn into the movie so well that we can emotionally understand that no one at the time knew the outcome of the morel dilemma, so basically no one's actions were clearly wrong or right; it is only in hindsight that our minds can decide that.In selling the drama, it certainly helps that everyone wants to work with Nolan: even the smallest parts are filled with great artists, from Florence Pugh as the strong-willed mistress, David Krumholz as a scientist with a clear moral compass, to Downey Jr. As an unforgettable two-faced politician, an achievement that should get him Oscar gold.A movie with so many perspectives, topics and timeframes could have easily become a top-heavy mess, and some sides could have been underplayed, but due to a great script, clear direction and skillfull editing, we never get lost in one big jumble of timelines and characters. The makers thoroughly manage to turn it into a great thriller drama in which all the pieces fall into place until the final shot, while still keeping the audience intellectually engaged, captivated and amused throughout the entire 3-hr runtime. And that work of precision may be the biggest achievement of all. Please bring out the Oscars!",Oppenheimer

6.0,Worst Nolan movie!,caglisto,22 July 2023,"""Worst Nolan movie! It's worth watching, but I'm not sure if it's worth the ticket. The story isn't bad because it's a true story; in fact, if you watch 'Fat Man and Little Boy,' you get the same story (albeit with fewer details), and it's a good story, even though the film is old and follows a linear structure. However, compared to Nolan's own films like 'Memento,' the structure of 'Oppenheimer' is indeed weak. 'Memento' is one of the best films in the history of cinema with that kind of structure. Also, you can take movies with a much simpler story that could be told in a short time, like David Finch's 'The Social Network,' which uses the same type of structure and works very well because it has the right amount of cuts and flashbacks. The film is already long, and so many flashbacks for a story like this made the movie tedious. Could see lots of people on their phones after 2h into the movie.Also, The film is easy to understand because no one explains or goes into detail about anything, to the point that it shows several people whom you won't know if you don't already know who they are, throughout the whole movie, you'll be left wondering. My friends asked me several things after the film, mostly about who was who. (-""Who is that guy he went to study with? -Who was the other one who did this or that?"")""",Oppenheimer

Its a biography of one of the most influential physicist of all time. Oppenheimer's character played by Cillian Murphy was just PERFECT. The intensity, complexity and tragedy of the brilliant minds of that time is portrayed like never before.. Also the cast overall is brilliant and unique. World war 2 is the most impactful event of the history of mankind. Personally its very intriguing to me and I love to study the history of our ancestors. The movie portrays the agony and guilt that came afterwards in the life of Oppenheimer. How he was comflicted within himself. How his agony eats him alive and how he was later misunderstood because of his character. I urge people to witness history like never before.",Oppenheimer
4.0,Bafflingly mediocre,nwsquadron,21 July 2023,"I have been thinking for 2 days and still I have no idea who the target audience for this film is. The first half of this movie is not bad at all but once Barbie and Ken leave barbieland the movie just completely falls apart. The message shoved in your face way too much and isnt subtle at all, characters that are set up early on are completely forgotten by the 3rd act in a bloated script filled with unnecissarily complex feministic views. For a movie about a children's toy, the dialogue is often much too complex and theres no way in hell a child is going to be able to understand whats going on; several lines left me scratching my head as the dialogue is way too overly complex. Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie are excellent casting choices with Gosling going above and beyond, nailing all of the comedic moments and elevating all of the material he was given to work with.For a movie I was incredibly excited for, I was severely let down and honestly cannot say I recommend this movie to anyone.

Although I understand that the producers try to address certain issues in society but this has absolutely no place in a Barbie movie. I don't really enjoy it when a highly extravaganted issues is being shoved into my face. I honestly cannot understand how the producers thought that's the way to do it.

9.0,Pink Magic!!!!!,zimmalakhtar,23 July 2023,"The most anticipated summer movie turned out to meet my expectations. The sets,acting,costumes,story line everything was pink magic. It is a very inspiring movie for girls but I think a bit too much feminism and toxicity.No doubt, the movie is advertising barbies but it's still a good find.It's light hearted and it kept it's humor throughout the film., even in deep scenes. The cast was perfect for their own respective roles but something was very disappointing for me that literally Dua Lipa's role was less than two minutes.Overall I think the movie is worth watching once in your life and it will be memorable. The soundtrack is perfect Dance the night by Dua Lipa was perfectly in place and also What was I made for.When I watched What was I made for on YouTube, I did not like it but in the cinema it was perfect.It is a great movie but not everyone will like it Waiting for Barbie number 2 now.

6.0,Overcooked,socceroos,23 July 2023,"It's not a bad film at all, but when you've got a director of Nolan's calibre at the helm, you expect more than what Oppenheimer has to offer.Many of the scenes felt way too rushed, like the actors were just trying to deliver their lines without thinking about what they were actually saying. There were also way too many scenes in general; it felt like a series of vignettes that oscillated between Oppenheimer's personal life and moral qualms, and the reverence/derision he received from those around him.The dialogue also hits you over the head a little too much, so much is made explicit through the characters' conversations that it's implausible anything resembling these interactions would've ever taken place.The acting is fantastic, Cillian Murphy absolutely nails the part, as does Emily Blunt, whose scything take-down of the interrogator towards the end is a real highlight of the film. Kenneth Branagh's performance as Niels Bohr was a head scratcher - I never knew Danes spoke with Afrikaner accents.All in all, yes it's a decent film but there's just too much going on.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Surprised but not disappointed,loicjanssen,19 July 2023,"I went into this movie thinking it would be a mature twist on the classical Barbie figure and the 'ideal' life of Barbie & Ken, as Barbie related content is usually known for.I was however quite surprised with the depth of the themes in this movie. The themes of gender equality and femininity were touched on in a very observant and interesting fashion, not necessarily pushing any agenda but instead giving the viewer their own opportunity to make their mind up and think a bit. Despite the serieus themes, the movie is very funny and gives a lot of big and small nudges to the Barbie franchise and history. It's remarkably weird at times, but in a good way.The acting by Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling is great, as well as by a lot of the side characters. The set designs are also amazingly done and give the movie a nice feel. The audience was very hyped up and clapped or screamed on multiple occasions, improving the cinema experience on our visit at the opening night as well.Would definitely recommend a cinema viewing!",Barbie

3.0,I fee sorry to those who fell in the Barbenheimer trap,Azureus91,20 July 2023,"To say that I was disappointed is an understatement. The movie starts fine which is more or less what was advertised in the trailers where the setting was Barbie. That was kind of fun. The problem is that the second part is just a mess in pace, it tries tooooo hard to be funny. The main message of the movie would have been great if it had been delivered properly. It was nowhere close to be succint. All Pixar movies do a better job at making their point. And for me, the worst of all, is that it tried to be controversial so hard that it became stale and dull after some minutes since everything centered around the same topic.Movies should try to unite not divide. At least create some discussion rather than being a one-way discussion where the writer basically tells everything.Parents: Not recommended to bring kids, it is not for them. It can be dull and the jokes are not aimed at that audience.Despite all of these problems, it deserves points for the first 30 mins of the movie, and the aesthetic.",Barbie
5.0,Terribly overrated claptrap.,markgorman,28 July 2023,"In which Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach recycle their failed 30 minute Black Mirror idea and pad it out to a full two hour shaggy dog tale, of little or no consequence, whilst breaking the hearts of nine year old girls worldwide who flock in their millions to a movie that flies straight over their heads.To be fair the first three minutes are awesome when they pastiche 2001 A Space Odyssey (but we'd already seen it in the trailer). And Margot Robbie is breathtakingly beautiful from start to finish.Ryan Gosling's faye Ken is, by contrast, just a bit annoying, (and to be fair, so is Robbie) but neither are as gratingly garbage as Will Ferrell and his bunch of Mattel men.Other highlights include Billie Eillish's stunningly gorgeous closing music which gets all existential on us.The design is, to a point, quite fun but not consistently so and the morale of the story, or the political polemic about equal rights for women, does not fail to land, although it does so in a Groundhog sort of manner.This is not a good movie. Gerwig, Baumback, Robbie and Gosling have all done significantly superior work. This is quite simply a bunch of talented people having a laugh and getting away with it.Hats of to Mattel for allowing a lot of self deprecation on their part and to the profits it will have raised for their mighty corpioration.But is this good cinema? No, it is not.",Barbie
2.0,Barbie-not good,thongman,22 July 2023,"The only reason this movie even gets a 2 from me is because Margot Robbie is a beautiful woman. It's 2 hours of my life I will never get back. A waste of money to see. Will Ferrell plays his usual ridiculous self as all of his roles. Ryan Gosling also has a role that is beneath him. Margot Robbie is a great actress and so much more capable than this role. A definite don't see this movie. It should have an age rating no one over the age of eight years old allowed unless accompanied by a toddler. Yes, it was that bad. An embarrassment to all who acted in this movie. The writers should be ashamed. This may be all that Hollywood is capable of during a writers strike. Hopefully there will not be a sequel to this God awful movie. I only saw it because my wife wanted to see it for some strange reason. I would have to say it's the worst movie I have ever paid to see hands down. So not waste your time or your money to go to this movie. Wait for it to go to video. It shouldn't take long.",Barbie
6.0,Strange but it has its positives,shakyblakey,22 July 2023,"Barbie was certainly unique. It has a simple plot which well fits its target youth audience, it does have moments of comedy but don't expect any other sorts of genres. Both Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie give a good performance which is convincing at times but not always. Greta Gerwig sometimes shows reasonably interesting and unique cinematography however most of the shots and music are predictable. This movie was packed with a star studded cast which lives it up to a greater name than it deserves. If you have young children they will certainly enjoy it, but if not I wouldn't recommend it to you.",Barbie
10.0,"Amazing movie, by an outstanding director and breathtaking performers",legallybrunette03,24 July 2023,"(let me apologize for my english beforehand) Oh my gosh... I don't even know where to start. I was very exited to watch this movie, and I decided to go see it for the first time with my best friend with whom I used to play barbies. However, I did not expected the movie to be so emotional: I cried in four different moments. In particular, the scene with the eldery woman on the bench makes me cry everytime I think about it! This movie touches a lot of parts about womanhood that we rearly get to see on the big screen, it critizes and in someways explains the patriarchy in a vey obvious way, whitch makes me think that the (mostly) men who are complaining about it have probably seen the movie with their eyes closed.Please, girls, go watch it with a woman you love, that makes you feel safe and let you be you, because this is an experience that needs to be shared with other women.It's one of the saddest movie I've ever seen, but somehow it filled me with hope. Now I'll go back crying about this movie while listening to ""what was i made for"" lol.",Barbie
10.0,It's da bomb,kosmasp,25 July 2023,"I struggled a little bit - I mean it is the obvious pun (that as always is not intended - never ever, yes?), so should I take the easy one? Well as you can see: I did. There were a few others I considered yesterday ... but none that really would have ... the impact of this one (yes I can't stop - like Oppenheimer himself maybe?) ... one if you are really that curious involved Asteroid City - not just because they came out this year - you also had many talented actors in it and a setting in the desert. Although it was mainly desert for AC and only partly for Oppenheimer of course.Not to mention many more differences - anyway let's not waste more time on that. And time you'll need, because this is a 3 hour affair! Still and even while I once looked on my watch (2 hours in), I was never bored or annoyed by the running time. While we know Nolan knows his stuff technically - sometimes some viewers may have issues with the story. Now depending on your knowledge of history, you may find certain things interesting and others less so.Apparently there is one huge ""mistake"" with flags being from a different era (decade) than the one they are used in. Since it is done in color (something Nolan admitted would be a subjective telling of happenings), that might have been on purpose. But small things like that should not deter you from liking or disliking the movie. A friend also pointed out that a spy related ""fact"" was not entirely accurate. Using """" in both instances to make clear I am not saying it is so ... kind of like Christopher Nolan you say? Well thank you so much.As already mentioned, the movie has colored and black and white segments. The latter being the ones that are supposed to be historically accurate. I can't vouce for total authenticity - and the movie may bring up questions you may want to research. Be it certain people or incidents. Oppenheimer - this is as close as we'll get to know or rather see him. From a safe distance - same goes for the ... bomb (yes another pun).The actors are amazing, though it felt that Emily Blunt was underused at first. Not knowing the real wife of Oppenheimer, I imagined that was just the way she was. But behold she will get her time to shine and be more than a two dimensional character. Another character in Nolan films is his editing style and his insistence not to use CGI - which is quite impressive. Even more so here ... all the stuff that is ... well even the small stuff you see on screen here. There are so many visual treats that I am amazed he did practical ... and there is even more to discover.Even without being a scientist you can easily follow the main theme of the movie. You will not get a lecture (again sorry and you're welcome) ... well not a full one at least. Even if you are not down with the movies theme - you can't deny the sheer power that Nolan releases (well Oppenheimer in that case - although even he didn't do it all by himself - he surrounded himself with the best people he could - kind of like Nolan? Well if you say so) ... and with that I say til next time - chances hopefully are way better than near zero you like my review.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Astounding - and not for any special effects,richard-1787,23 July 2023,"This is one of the most intriguing and astounding movies I have had the pleasure of seeing in my over 60 years of movie going. Yes, there are some impressive special effects, but they are truly the least impressive things here.First is the script. A GREAT deal of history is condensed into three hours of often quickly delivered dialogue. It is succinct, and it is often brilliantly structured. Flashbacks, flashforwards, jump cuts, etc. Not to impress, as was too often the case in Dunkirk, but to create an ever richer tapestry of historical events and tie them together. Definitely deserves an Oscar.Second is the directing. Getting all of this to flow, and often rush forward in an intelligent and cohesive way was an act, or many acts, of directorial genius. Nolan was nominated for a Best Director Oscar for Dunkirk, but didn't win. This time he should definitely win. His work bringing all this together is phenominal.The acting is all fine to very fine. It should definitely make a star out of Cillian Murphy, whom I had never heard of before but who does a fine job as Oppenheimer. Damon is good as Groves, though I suspect some of his dialogue was ""enhanced"" to make the character more interesting. I read Groves' book on the Manhattan project. He didn't come off as that blunt and forceful.The editing is also remarkable. I was especially impressed with some of the sound choices at crucial moments, such as the explosion of the test bomb. It keeps you on your toes and makes you think because it delivers the unexpected.This movie is 3 hours long. I was not bored for a single minute.My hat is off to Nolan. This is truly a work of genius.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Come on Barbie let's go party,JEBaeza,21 July 2023,"""Barbie"" may seem like an improbable concept for a thought-provoking film, but director Greta Gerwig skillfully harnesses this cultural icon to deliver a potent and profound message. Gerwig delicately weaves a narrative that explores the complexities of gender dynamics without vilifying either gender, demonstrating that Kens in Barbieland face similar challenges as real-world women. The film also touches on the importance of embracing diversity and dismantling societal barriers. The movie's production design deserves applause, staying true to the beloved Barbie toys while ingeniously utilizing their features to propel the story forward. Margot Robbie delivers a phenomenal performance as Barbie, injecting depth and nuance into a character often dismissed as one-dimensional. Ryan Gosling, as Ken, complements the film with his adept portrayal, enhancing the chemistry between the characters, while America Ferrera's character brings a layer of relatability to the story. Gerwig's clever balance of humor and poignancy ensures that the movie achieves its goal of raising awareness without alienating its audience. A delightful yet meaningful cinematic experience.",Barbie

8.0,You'll appreciate this 'life in plastic' film more than you can ever imagine. 💗,iamianiman,20 July 2023,"Only Greta Gerwig can pull this movie off. She is the only one that can helm this movie right. No other directors can do what she did for this movie. Why? Because the others would end up making this movie as generic or as plain as possible aka 'just another commercial blockbuster movie'. Greta Gerwig was able to turn the wheels from the overly used direction, venturing into new territories most directors are afraid to go.Barbie the Movie sends out strong messages and contexts about a lot of different things. Some of them include patriarchy, male-dominated world, female-dominated world, perfectionism, teenage-phase life, adulting, gender equality, equity, sexual objectifications amongst many others. Now, you must be shocked to hear all of this are conveyed in this film. A Barbie film that talks about all this stuff? YES. This is Greta's X-Factor, having to bring these sensitive subjects into a movie for everyone catered for all audiences. And children will still be entertained and understood with the story and the messages that Barbie brings to the table.Verdict: Filled with contexts and messages as rich as Oscar-nominated films, Barbie the Movie is a whole different game as it is full with surprises and hard-hitting truths about the world we live in today. It is self-aware of what it is and Greta Gerwig daringly takes charge of crafting a masterpiece storytelling that capitalizes on the heavy subjects without downgrading anything or anyone, maintaining both its quality and substance the entire film. You'll appreciate this 'life in plastic' film more than you can ever imagine. 💗",Barbie

9.0,Best movie since Cruella,theisensean,23 July 2023,"A breath of fresh air from almost all movies made in the past 10 years. Great acting, amazing set designs and a wonderfully interesting story with a few twists! I've been so turned off with many of the movies made in the past 10 years due to poor storylines, and an extreme over abundance of CGI, which I'm guessing most people like because that's the bulk of movies nowadays. This movie had me smiling or laughing most of the time, with a few heartfelt moments which brought a tear or two to my eyes.

9.0,"Oppenheimer, a unforgettable movie .",mittoo,23 July 2023,"Saw the movie "" OPPENHEIMER "" at PVR Phoenix( Parel) on the first day second show of its release in India on Friday(22/7/2023). As a student of history found the movie true to its era of "" World War II "" but was also surprized regarding the bold sex scenes in the film. Definitely a bit censured to Indian audiences. The film was extraordinary in special effects while depicting the testing of the first atomic bomb and subtle in not showing the dropping of the 2 atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Having visited Zurich was amazed to see the Grossmünster church towers depicted in the initial introduction of the film. Excellent movie but could be boring for non history buffs.

And it's interesting that just as we played with our dolls, the Barbies in the movie were also taken into play! Then one of my childhood dreams that was Barbie in the real world came true and it was interesting to me... How wonderful it is that Margot Robbie was chosen to perform this role.. She did it perfectly.",Barbie
7.0,"Brilliant, Powerful, & Complicated",christinawilliams-64144,23 July 2023,"The movie itself is not about the Manhattan Project. Its merely depicted. It instead heavily focuses on Oppenheimer himself. The movie is tasked with answering a single question throughout the entire movie: Is Oppenheimer a man to be trusted? The development of the movie is very well designed. Oppenheimer is a complicated man, with strong beliefs and who is entitled to those beliefs, and yet he is constantly interrogated for not just being the man who invented the atomic bomb, but for whether or not he is being loyal to America. Forces beyond his control and people who plot against him, but he has the wit and strength of a scientist who must prove to no one that he is in fact human.The plot since it tells the story of Oppenheimer is very well written. Its highly intelligent and has many twists. Its told in the past, present, future with referencing each many times. The beginning is a bit slow and theres a lot of science knowledge everywhere so any audience members that dont know a lot will end up being confused. But the dialogue is very intelligent and theres lots of it, frankly sometimes there too much of it to where it gets boring.However, the camera focuses mostly on Oppenheimers perspective, shots can be seen from multiple angles. The sound was thrilling, startling, loud, and suprisingly powerful. It captured the movie. Not just the bomb itself, but its like we are in Oppenheimer's mind breathing in his sights and hearing thoughts. The graphics are just as powerful that captures the attention of the audience.Overall, the purpose of this movie is a hidden message-to determine if Oppenheimer is trustworthy to science and to America. He is tasked with building a bomb, and he feels the weight of not entirely being thrilled about it. He is convicted of the humanity of killing a death weapon, that would at that time possibly destroy the world. The task is difficult because Oppenheimer is put into a difficult position for the sake of the war.But once the war is over, he feels the fear of others against him. Oppenheimer is after all only human. He expresses remorse and makes mistakes in the movie that shatters his family. He grieves for those who the bomb killed. He advocates for the freedom of having strong beliefs such as his. And so the movie must then answer the question, should America give him security clearance? Is he a good citizen?",Oppenheimer
6.0,Overall a decent movie but not worth the hype,anandsaid-76415,23 July 2023,"The kind of movie which peaked at the moments leading to the main event rather than the main event. Honestly, was a bit disappointed considering the hype it got . The politics , which is there substantially in the film was kind of boring and lengthy . Not a fan of the explosion or the sound effects considering the hype the film got in that partCinematography was next level , just as what to expect from a Christopher Nolan movie .Acting was outstanding. Suprised by how well Emily blunt did the scenes and instilled a whole new wow factor to the movie . Also the Black and white IMAX shots were also beautiful which gave a different feel to the movie . Also , try to understand basics of atomic reactions and bombs to grasp the scientific aspects of the movie better before you watch it .",Oppenheimer

I was not expecting all the deep emotions that the film gave. Life is not all about perfection, which a lot of people wants to constantly achieve these days, imperfections is what identifies us and that's okay.I'm a visual kind of cinema goer and I have the say that dance sequence (Dance the Night) and the scene where Barbie and Ken where traveling to the real world were AMAZING. Kudos to the creative team behind it, I absolutely adore the set.Greta Gerwig and her team delivered a visual spectacle with a heart.",Barbie
5.0,"Now I am become death, destroyer of the patriarchy",luckybucksproductions,22 July 2023,"(Note: I highly recommend seeing both this film and Oppenheimer as a double feature. Both are heavy handed films that have characters going through an existential crisis and are consumed with thoughts of death. You would think these two films have nothing in common, but I'm dead serious - no pun intended.)When your film has your narrator saying the word ""feminism"" in the first five minutes, you know it's going to be problematic.Now, don't get me wrong. I have no problem with feminism and I consider myself a feminist. Some of my favorite films have feminist characters. I knew going in this film was going to be woke. I just didn't realize how woke till I saw it, which was kind of a disappointment anyway.First off, don't let the cutesy pink marketing fool you. This is not a film for kids, but that happens quite a lot in Hollywood. For example, Drop Dead Fred was a film I saw when I was 10, but it was really for adults. But at least it wasn't woke. I felt kind of sorry for the little girls I saw wearing their pretty pink outfits and dresses knowing that probably much of the preaching against the patriarchy and lack of genitalia jokes were going to go over their heads.Yep. I said what I said. It only gets worse from there.Margot Robbie plays the titular Barbie who lives in Barbieland with all her fellow Barbies that can do it all and have it all. The Kens are kind of just...there. The main Ken played by Ryan Gosling, gets tired of being from friend zoned and taken for granted by Barbie. When Barbie starts to have thoughts of her own mortality, has flat feet, and cellulite, she is advised by Kate McKinnon (one of the few bright spots in the film as Weird Barbie) to go to the Real World to find the girl who's playing with her and make everything right. Ken decides to stow away in Barbie's pink Corvette. Both of them discover the Real World is not what it seems.My biggest problem with this film was the constant preachiness, especially when Barbie and Ken go to the Real World, and it never really stops from there. I resented Greta Gerwig for ""giving the game away"". There's a way to talk about feminism without hammering it over the head and alienating half your audience, in this case men, but I doubt many men will see it. It's like that South Park episode when Randy makes a musical that explicitly talks about oral sex until he is advised to tone it down and hide the message in subtext. That's what Gerwig and her partner Noah Baumbach should have done with the story. This is a film that definitely skews toward a female audience. It needed to be more subtle with the messaging. I would have preferred a fun, silly, colorful Barbie film rather than having a woke agenda pushed on me. Unfortunately, that's the direction Hollywood seems to have embraced these days.However, the visuals were bright, fun, and colorful along with the hairstyles and wardrobe. I liked that they filmed in the Venice Beach Boardwalk and other areas around LA. Despite the diversity of the cast, my mom was unhappy that she didn't see a Hispanic Barbie and Ken (even though we saw a white, black, and Asian Ken). If there were any in the cast, I didn't see them. America Ferreira and her daughter are indeed Latina, but that wasn't enough for her. She does have a point, though, but we could be wrong and missed them. Will Ferrell is wasted as the CEO of Mattel, but I don't care for him anyway, so it didn't really matter that I didn't see him much. Rhea Perlman did have a nice little part as the creator of Barbie, Ruth Handler.This film was very strange and I felt kind of alienated by it. Plus, the last scene of the film was anticlimactic and totally bizarre. I get the good intentions by the filmmakers, but it was way too preachy for me. Legally Blonde was the closest to a Barbie film up until this point and it was a feminist film that never felt like it was preaching to its audience. Elle Woods was a blonde Barbie type character who was underestimated because of her looks, but manages to showcase her intelligence and strength as a successful lawyer without the message of the story becoming too heavy handed and retaining the lighthearted playfulness throughout, which is what Barbie is missing. I think I'll just stick to that film instead.",Barbie
7.0,Barbie: an enjoyable mess.,shayenu,20 July 2023,"Barbie is enjoyable, thats for sure, but it brings some problems such as the films plot, which is all over the place, and goes in a lot of unlikable directions at times. However, this doesn't bring the film down, as there are enjoyable and smart aspects of the film that climb the hurdles to make Barbie an enjoyable summer watch that caters for all ages!The film kicks things off in Barbie land, and its here where audiences will start to fall in love with the aesthetics of the film. Astonishing set designs,usage of visual fx and cinematography really help us step into the shoes of a Barbie doll. The first act of the film really focus on this idea, and almost shows off the impressive work that has been put into the creation of this sublime world.It is when we delve further into this plot though that we start to see issues. The whole vibe the film gives off and its tone surprisingly shifts into something much darker and political when the real world gets involved. It is definitely far from unwatchable though, and the charm of the characters and the humor actually make this specific part of the storyline enjoyable. Despite being fun, the story goes off track a lot, completely ignoring any form of logic to take risks by giving off a little too many messages that only makes the plot more predictable and cliché.The individual, interior journeys these characters go on though is the clear standout of the film for me. The arcs of almost all characters are played out really cleverly, and whilst the story as a whole is a mess, the developing dynamics between the Barbie's and the Ken's make this film worth watching alone. What is done with these characters is really fitting to some of the messages the film tries to give off, even though it may seem there are too many to process.Acting is phenomenal. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are CLEAR standouts, yet all cast members have their moments.Ultimately, Barbie does get messy, especially when the real-world comes to play. Yet its the exploration of Barbie Land and what it means to be a barbie that make this a fun, yet somewhat perceptive, summer watch!",Barbie
9.0,One of the best films of the year,mr_bickle_the_pickle,26 July 2023,"If you're going in expecting an action heavy film filled with explosions, then this probably isnt for you. The film is centered around a trial against Oppenheimer and is mostly told through flashbacks. One through the biased POV of Strauss (Robert Downey Jr) and through Oppenheimer himself (Cillian Murphy). The film is long - and also feels very long. So you definitely have to be in the right mindset to sit down and watch. But I really enjoyed watching this exploration of this man and his psyche. The film poses a lot of questions about whether one should have this power. And it actually made me want to read a biography about him.There was headlines before the film came out about the sex scenes. Florence is topless but otherwise nothing else is explicitly shown. There is one scene where they are both sitting naked across from each other that felt unnecessary, mainly as it just felt random, that they could have cut out. But otherwise, kind of tame. I don't know why it was hyped up as much it was.The film also has a ton of cameos. Almost to the point where it becomes a bit distracting. And not all of them are necessary. Does Jack Quaid really do anything in this movie for instance? But none of them are bad. Definitely Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr and Emily Blunt are the highlights of the film though and would also be deserving of Oscar nominations.One of the best films of the year.",Oppenheimer
9.0,"Nolan delivers dazzling, dizzying character study of a flawed man who changed the world",caleblimsw,21 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan tackles one of the most divisive scientific achievements in human history--the invention of the atomic bomb--through the lens of it's chief creator, J. Robert Oppenheimer, and the resulting fallout this achievement had on Oppenheimer himself.A devastating and unflinchingly clear movie, it weaves through time with two main points of view, filmed alternatively in beautifully rendered colour and in a starkly entrancing black and white. This movie must be seen in a movie theatre, it practically demands it, with sweeping shots and visual effects of the absolute highest calibre. There is no question that what you are seeing is practically reality, the complexity and beauty of the visuals giving the sense that you are seeing things exactly as Oppenheimer saw them. It is a stunning achievement of direction, to make a movie so in-tune with its main character that every single emotion can be felt through the screen, and much of that can be attributed to the capability of Cillian Murphy, the undoubted star of this movie, whose piercing eyes and extreme subtlety lend to him a quiet fragility amongst total and utter conviction, unpicking a man of contradictions in a manner which reveals the depth of feeling and conflict that Oppenheimer battled throughout his life. He is not an easy character to like, and that is the point. He is a flawed genius, as they all are, a man with ego, with compassion, with the mental strength to coordinate a titanic effort to change the world, and whose emotions can be overwhelmed in a single phone call.A triumph of perspective, it is a character study which leaps through time and space in a way which would unbalance most biopics. Under Nolan's careful hand, every sequence informs another, slowly unfurling, slowly building tension which reaches not one, not two, but three spectacular peaks of release.Between these peaks, however, are the troughs, necessary exposition and quieter moments given to the movie, where it almost feels like the train is running to a stop, only for it to pick up and roar you straight into the heart of the next great scene. These troughs are where the movie wallows a little too much osce-wise, where it gets lost in the details and becomes a little muddled.Its other great failure is the scarcity of character given in particular to Kitty, Oppenheimer's wife, and his two children. Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh give more dimension to characters who, through no fault of their own, are forced onto the sidelines through the sheer scope of Nolan's narrative, but whose involvement is still vital to the emotional core of the movie. Robert Downey Jr takes the other big role of Lewis Strauss, a government official who recruits Oppenheimer to a government board on Atomic Energy after the war. He gives Strauss the necessary charisma, the necessary intensity to push back against Murphy's total control of the screen.Ludwig Goransson's score is exceptional, motifs appearing perfectly in sync with a superb sound design, lending so much extra intensity and detail to so many sequences in this movie. The sound design is simply perfection, adding to the narrative and to the character of Oppenheimer as well. Jennifer Lame's editing is so so brilliant, especially in the sequences where tension is high. Clean, efficient, technically masterful editing which turns scenes into with hammer blows.Lastly, Tom Conti's brief appearances as the famed physicist Albert Einstein provide the perfect pivot moments of the movie, putting down a definitive stamp of almost prophetic authority on a fittingly complex, nuanced, and chillingly beautiful portrait of the man who helped change the reality of the world as we know it.",Oppenheimer

10.0,Best movie ever!,yOlgainwonderland,23 July 2023,"Didn't watch the trailer and went to see the Barbie movie, thinking it would be a regular comedy about a doll. I liked the idea of dressing up in pink with my daughter and going to a girly movie. But I was very surprised when I found out that there was a deep meaning hidden in the pink world of Barbie Land! The movie touches on women's issues: being always perfect, managing everything, being beautiful, perfect mothers, cooks, careerists and wives. The movie also shows men who don't know who they are without their women, cars, jobs. I cried, I was moved by the dialogues. I loved the movie! I was especially impressed by the moment at the bus stop, when Barbie sat next to an old lady and praised her for her beauty. The old lady smiled and said: I know :) It was so cute and wise! It made me realize that growing old is not scary if you love yourself as you are. You don't need to chase youth, there is beauty and dignity in every age. I am grateful to the directors Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach for making the Barbie movie not only a fun comedy, but also a deep drama about finding yourself and your place in the world. They showed that Barbie is not just a doll, but a heroine who can be anyone and do anything. They also honored the memory of Ruth Handler, who gave millions of girls the opportunity to dream and strive for the best. I think that the Barbie movie is not only a movie for children, but also for adults who want to go back to their roots and find their inner beauty. I recommend this movie to everyone who loves Barbie or just wants to watch a good movie with an important message.",Barbie
1.0,What to say really,thijsbosma-17782,22 July 2023,This is a movie much more about politics and conspiracy than about the development of the nuclear bomb. The trailer is very misleading. The incessant music drowned out the dialogue and the non-chronological edits were very confusing. No charcter buildup. No emotion. A visually provocative biopic that seems less interested in character study. Hard to care about this movie. People and critics are saying they like this movie more than they do because they want to think of themselves as smart. Disappointed. This director is highly overrated and the false genius satus must have gone to his head.If you wanna see a good movie in the same genre watch the imitation game instead. Oppenheimer is not worth your time.,Oppenheimer
4.0,Disappointing,aharmas,22 July 2023,"It saddens me that so many people are mistaking bigger and louder with quality. First of all, a loud soundtrack. No matter how good it might be doesn't equate to quality. In this film, it is overwhelming not complementing the film.For the past year we kept hearing to see in IMAX, a format that is perfect for magnificent visuals and sound effects. Strangely, this pseudo documentary has very little that benefits from the enhanced film format.We have 99 percent straightforward standard presentation of nothing very special. It's is pretty much all talk, with.no memorable backgrounds, camera angles or special framing.Then we have the big event, something that lasts five minutes and it is very underwhelming. I couldn't relate it to a nuclear or atomic reaction. Why the need for IMAX or any premium format?What we have the opportunity to see is the depiction of pretty choppy and overlapping dialogue that does.nothing to allow us to follow the events as the movie jumps between various dates and points of view. Here is where I wonder about the need to shoot it in both color or black and white.We certainly are not dealing with Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's list or Manhattan here. Those movies allowed us to relish what outstanding cinema could give us... The pain and glory of a complex life or event.Let's be fair and give something it's due. A 10 used to meant perfection, not just the glare or the sparkles. Remember not all that shines is gold.",Oppenheimer
8.0,"Glad I watch this movie, fantastic!",Mysterygeneration,23 July 2023,"Even though she is only a doll, she does not have to be an airhead. Here in lies ""Lady Bird"" filmmaker Greta Gerwig's creative, modern-day approach to bringing one of America's most recognizable toys to life on screen. When you add that to the decision to cast Margot Robbie in the lead role, ""Barbie"" is off to the right, flawlessly arched start.Barbie's aspirational charm contributes to her brand's strength. Barbie has been criticized for imposing unattainable beauty standards, but she also served as a reminder to girls that everything is possible because different models have depicted her as the president, a rocket scientist, and even transgender. Do you know who else has inflated ideals of beauty? Celebrities in movies. They act as role models, much like Barbie, which is why Gerwig's interpretation of the wildly successful toy brand is so creative.While making Ryan Gosling's dumb Ken the brunt of most of its gender-equity humor, this film hits all the appropriate criteria. The result is a very funny children's film with the phrases of a first-year liberal arts student, which tosses around terms like ""patriarchy"" and ""appropriation"" - pretty much everything but ""problematic,"" which the film means without actually referring to Barbie's legacy.The script by Gerwig and Noah Baumbach feels most audacious on this front. The hit movie ""Barbie"" openly accuses the best-selling doll of undermining the women's movement in addition to making light of Mattel.With a subject like this, the power of nostalgia shouldn't be understated, since much of Gerwig's approach affects mature women and homosexual audiences who have owned the dolls - and for whom she has concealed references and deep-cut facts throughout. Even though Gerwig occasionally uses the film as the vehicle for what seems like a gender studies lecture for undergraduates, it is evident that the movie was created by professionals who understand how children's imaginations develop while playing with Barbies.",Barbie
9.0,This is definitely a Christopher Nolan film.,rmfairfax35,21 July 2023,"I just watched this movie, and it is an ambitious film in portraying Robert Oppenheimer. The cast which you may know were in the movie and some you didn't know had small roles were all excellent. I thought Murphy and RDJ were the standouts. The one role who I thought seemed superfluous was Florence Pugh's character. To me she didn't seem too vital to the story aside from seeing her boobs in IMAX. Nolan could've put anyone in that role, and it would have had the same superficial effect. Aside from that the only quibble I have is the score is sometimes so loud that I could NOT understand what some of the characters were saying. As for the rest of the film it was relentless in telling Oppenheimer's story. It was as well made as cinema can get nowadays. You were absolutely immersed in the mid to late 40's . So much so that if you aren't a person even mildly knowledgeable about the subject then you may get lost as this film does not hold your hand in explaining what is occurring.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Fun filled with depth,ruelshepperd,25 July 2023,"Greta Gerwig hasn't missed yet with a film but this film is her first larger budget film. Similar to The Lego Movie, this film appears to be a harmless, funny commercial with a simple message but also like The Lego Movie, great writing and performances make it a heartfelt film with strong themes and messages.The plot is fairly straightforward with our main Barbie going on a journey of self-discovery in the real world, while Ken does the same. A simple premise but well executed. The plot deals with themes such as gender, equality, the loss of childhood and the nature of growing up with such good humour and heart. I had a smile on my face the entire time.The performances are strongest from the two leads, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. Both bring a lot of energy and life to Barbie and Ken, communicating the struggles of being both a man and woman and how one can't exist without the other. They have excellent chemistry and both inject their roles with great emotion. The rest of the cast are good though some felt unnecessary. Will Ferrell's CEO could have benefitted from more screen time or could've even been cut completely. Yet he is still hilarious in the scenes he is in.The set design is immaculate, Barbieland was a joy to witness. My only issue is we could've spent more time there. The score was great and the cinematography further helped with the immersion. Production-wise this film is gorgeous.The only problems are a few too many times of the film hammering it's message in to the point it can become annoying. There are also a few lines and jokes that don't land at all and seem entirely of the time. Yet, these are minor in the face that everything does right.Overall, Barbie is a lot of fun, with great comedy and a lot of heart. The leads are great, the set design is immaculate and the message is strong and positive. A fun film that I highly recommend.",Barbie
1.0,ALL 180 MINUTES FOR CONVERSATION ONLY!!,sheikh-24412,22 July 2023,"180minutes is just for conversation. No action at all. Slow pace like snail. If there is -ve Star rating, then i'll give it -ve. Its feels like forever to finish this movie.There is no plot for this movie. From beginning till the end just talk talk talk talk. This is absolutely not what i expect.Let me list the great movies of all time; Titanic, Jack Reacher, Angel Has Fallen, Armageddon, Hidden Figures, Rocky 4, Dark Knight, Kenshin, Shaolin Soccer, The Mask, Hell The Judge, Final Destination 1I don't get it why the rating so high for Oppenheimer. Its impossible to repeat this movie. I came with the high expectation because of the hype & high rating. After 30minutes watching this movie, im hoping it end very soon. Damn boring. Really frustrated coz this film is far below expectation.",Oppenheimer
8.0,We're All Dolls,klastaitas,28 July 2023,"Without consumerism, without belief, without plastic accessory and hope for a perfect day, where would Barbie find herself?And more importantly where would we find ourselves?In a plot that seems stitched together like an old pair of vintage jeans (that you just can't let go of), Greta Gerwig serves us a platter of modern satire and deep analysis of the condition that we find ourselves in today.Barbie is perfect. Until she's not. And she's becomes accustomed to our culture. The perspective of an otherwise perfect doll born from a matriarchy is wholly interesting and captivating as we laugh, hate and cry throughout the movie. Barbie must find out what is wrong with her owner but in doing so she discovers imperfect humanity and falls in love with it. This is the story and it is told brilliantly.There is no need to mention the phenomenal performances by each and every actor in this film. The set design, the costumes, the cinematography are all a testament to Greta Gerwigs skill as a director.To view this film as merely a feminist blockbuster is to ignore the fact that feminism is not just woman's problem but a humanity's problem. This is what the movie displays. Go into it with an open mind and you will see that it does not preach for women to rule men but for men and women to discover themselves without being pressured by the culture around them. A message which needs to be broadcast across the world in a time of such needless division.We are all forced to live like dolls in this world and we must escape from this and discover ourselves. It is amazing to see Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach tackle such daring themes and pull it off. The comedy throughout provided by celebrity cameos and hilarious satire is spot on.The soundtrack is astounding and in particular Billie Eilish's song ""What was I made for?"" is a fantastic close to the journey of discovery that Barbie and Ken have been through.A brilliant achievement in modern film making that makes me hopeful for the future as we tackle more and more complex issues head on - rather than watch boring old men debate uselessness on YouTube.",Barbie
10.0,The best ever?,omarmajedfifa,19 July 2023,"Man I can't describe how I feel , I feel amazed, I feel sad , I feel emotional. I really wish to watch that movie again if could, like who wouldn't like that peace of masterpiece, Christopher Nolan never let you down when he directs a movie.that Man will be the best director to ever come in history. I can't believe what he did honestly. The film is perfect in many ways The music in the background, the graphics, the acting prefromance from the actors , the filming. I'll be so sad if they didn't at least win 4 Oscars awards I'll be so f#ckin mad , at last I really do recommend to watch the film at least 2 times and yeah that's all.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Extraordinary film but something to be watched from home as it is a drama thriller,smrocktown,22 July 2023,"The quality of the movie is just as expected from christopher nolan. Extremely well structured and top class.Everything is great about the movie, the acting is top notch. Sound design is just out of this world. The theatre was shaking from the sound design. I have a feeling that nolan specifically chooses these frequencies of sounds which will cause the most vibrational effect and physical shake. The explosions felt like a friggin earthquake or blast wave was about to hit me and i was actually experiencing a real bomb.That was the best part of it in the cinema. But there are no spectacular visuals in this movie. I was expecting to see a scene with the dropping of the atom bomb or some war scenes at the very least. But none of that is there.Its a very intelectual movie mostly filled with talking and drama. Dont miss it! But there is no need to go to the cinemas. Watch it from home.",Oppenheimer
10.0,An unforgettable experience,WaliedNassier,22 July 2023,"Before I say my opinion, many people thought that the movie was classified as dynamic and expected fighting scenes, and so on. This is a grave mistake. The movie is a biography, all of it on Robert Oppenheimer. A conversational experience that is one of the most enjoyable. This is the strength of the movie. It is the language of dialogue between the actors. This is the basis of the movie. Not to mention the scenes of the nuclear bomb, which I classify as one of the best scenes that I could have seen in my life, the powerful acting, and more than expected from Robert Downey Jr. The whole experience is more than wonderful, and we must not forget the soundtrack from heaven, and I expect an Oscar for this music.",Oppenheimer
6.0,A fun watch with your partner,pedrochazbh,23 July 2023,"Barbie can offer genuine fun when enjoyed with a partner and a carefree attitude, but I strongly advise against watching it in the cinema. The movie lacks the expected nostalgia that a Barbie film should evoke, and it is riddled with hypocrisy and statements that don't hold true within the storyline.At its best, the movie is decent. The acting overral is commendable, especially with Margot Robbie delivering a great performance and being a good fit for her role. Some scenes are enjoyable and endearing, capable of eliciting laughter and providing a good time, but they don't leave a lasting impact. The soundtrack, from my perspective, was consistently great throughout the film with just a couple odd choices.However, my main issue with the movie lies in its overt push of social and political views onto the audience. Instead of letting the viewers interpret the themes on their own, the film explicitly spells out its messages, which can be off-putting. The movie seems too focused on trying to please every audience, resulting in a predictable Hollywood cliché.Moreover, it appears that the film fails to cater to two significant demographics. Younger viewers might struggle to follow the movie and comprehend its messages, leaving them disconnected and confused. On the other hand, older audiences, who would have been the main target for nostalgic appeal, may find this aspect lacking in the film, missing an opportunity to connect on a deeper level.In summary, while Barbie can be enjoyable when approached with the right mindset and company, the movie falls short of meeting expectations. The strong performances and some fun moments are marred by heavy-handed messaging and a failure to deliver the nostalgia that fans were hoping for.",Barbie
9.0,Another Masterpiece from Nolan,janneknetzel,28 July 2023,"First of all, everything that follows is my personal opinion, everyone can have a different opinion and that's a good thing. The complexity of the film is a major point of criticism for many, which I can understand in some ways, although I see it differently. Because the complexity of Nolan's films is why I love them so much. It's a change from the dull action films that are too haf produced. It is true that Oppenheimer is also mentally demanding and makes your head pound, however me and my 4 friends (all 15 years old) enjoyed the film very much and learned a lot about the story of this brilliant man and the film despite the well understood at different time levels. Not completely, of course, but you have to be prepared for that with a Nolan film. One can't rave enough about the acting cillian murphy and robert downey jr's performance was absolutely superb and definitely worthy of an Oscar. The rest of the cast is also incredibly strong. I thought every 5 minutes ""what? You're playing too?"". And as if that weren't enough, everything is staged in an absolutely grandiose way and during one scene my mouth just dropped open and I just asked myself ""how???"". And last but not least, the absolutely ingeniously adapted music makes every single scene perfect.",Oppenheimer
10.0,weakness to strength,JankiSharma,24 July 2023,"Greta Gerwig Director of Little women and Lady bird did a great job directing movie Barbie. I did not own or play with barbie dolls. Made the whole concept of Barbie very enjoyable and motivational for women in general .Margot Robbie is perfect as Barbie, beautiful in appearance, perky by nature. After stepping into reality , Barbie meets strong women ..different Barbie.. There is a Barbie with different labels... women in all fields. Conventional ordinary Barbie is not ordinary anymore. The movie is 1hr 54 minutes. In the beginning it is all about beautiful Barbie and then a beautiful twist to the story with planet earth having Barbie in all aspects and professions of life. I thoroughly enjoyed Ken ( excellent lovable Ryan Gosling) wanting Barbie and seeking for conventional Barbie in now matured Barbie Margot Robbie. Fun, great movie with lots of lessons for empowering women and teaching little girls to step out of beautiful fake kitchens and playhouses and feeding dolls. New dimension to womanhood is beautifully embedded in impressionable brains of little girls and teenagers rushing in pink clothes to feel like Barbie. Great job , Greta Gerwig. Adorable perfect Margot Robbie as Barbie who steps out of conventional type cast beauty. Excellent ensemble.",Barbie
10.0,Brilliant,daffyduck-06098,25 July 2023,"In one's life some things that come along simply blow you away and this movie is one of those things,! The cast of this movie not only were well chosen and brilliant acted. This has to be seen. It's hard to review this movie and not give away too much, but it's a complete and immersive experience which also explains what goes on in the back ground. I simply knew that people built a nuclear bomb and that two of them were dropped on Japan which bought the end to world war 2. A terrible time in our history. The audience in the cinema we went to were very respectful and the brilliance of the movie is why I hope movies like this continue to be made.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Undeniable Masterpiece,mbhancock1,23 July 2023,"There's never been a movie like this before. Hopefully there will be more like it in the future. Thank you to Nolan and the entire production team and cast. This film delivers in every area - it's a piece of art produced by masters of their craft.It's also a very dense and heavy film. It's sweeping but taut. It's calm but urgent. It feels like an immense energy that may either explode or collapse in with violent force, but is kept at a tenuous balance.And as others have said, after it's done you may not know how to feel. (Unless you're the ~6 year old who I saw walking out of my screening, I'm pretty sure he didn't like it, because there's no way in hell a child A] should watch this film or B] can comprehend this film. I digress).It's a film that will stick with you. It's intelligent and demanding storytelling that I hope we'll get to see a lot more like it in the coming years. It's also a good idea to watch it in theaters. The 3 hours fly by.",Oppenheimer
8.0,I'm Just A Ken,powellian6,24 July 2023,"I have successfully completed Barbenheimer and what a wonderful weekend for cinema it was. Every so often is their polar opposite releases but none ever this big. I saw packed theatres consistently on both days which was an amazing thing to be apart of. It felt very much like the old days of going to the theatres for any movie and the auditorium being absolutely packed!Barbie follows stereotypical Barbie as her normal perfect life gets disturbed by something happening in the real world as to which she has to leave Barbie world and fix her life.This is the bare bones of the story but Greta Gerwig explores so much more than that. It's obvious the film is highly inspired by films such as Wizard of Oz, La La Land and 2001 space odyssey to name a few. The talent behind the camera is very obvious and this is extremely stylized film. All of the Barbie stuff is top notch and the sets they built feels like something Tim Burton cooked up. Really excellent set design, costumes and props throughout this film.I was really worried that this film would spend too much time in the real world and it doesn't. It focuses alot of its story in Barbie World which I really appreciated. Margot Robbie is perfect in the role and continues to showcase her acting chops. Ryan Gosling is amazing too he has the perfect comedic timing and delivery. Perfect casting combo for this role.Barbie is a much deeper character exploration and interesting topic point that is very aesthetically shown in this film. No matter what you believe in there is an honest message and I'm sure many girls of all ages will relate to this film on one level or another.",Barbie
9.0,Just got amazed,sosrivi,20 July 2023,"Oppenheimer is not solely based on the Trinity. It's entirely political drama. Just a reminder to the audience of how obsessed humans are with power and fame. Music is the true hero of Oppenheimer's film. Every highest point throughout the film causes enormous tension. Everyone did an excellent job. The visual grandeur of Trinity underwhelmed me, but the music helped to compensate. Nolan has once again demonstrated his ability to present a political drama. Where all of the mental state were handled flawlessly. Overall, a remarkable image and historical significance that should never be forgotten. The film will leave you speechless.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Even non-Barbie fans can enjoy this!,kjcvvv,23 July 2023,"I am not a huge Barbie fan. I want to say that right out of the gate. My mom, however, has a massive collection. She was at just the right age when the dolls came out that Barbie was a huge part of her life. Knowing that, I took her to see Barbie yesterday morning.Parents of young children, there's nothing majorly inappropriate going on but you may want to wait on this one. While it's visually stunning, I wouldn't call it a kids movie. There are lots of complex themes woven into it that younger kids may not understand.Production design is stellar! In scenes where some of the infamous Barbie dream house is involved, the props behave just like Barbie toys do. It's a subtle reminder that the team understood the assignment & did not disappoint.The costume design is also amazing. There are joking references to costumes that were discontinued that fans of the toy line will enjoy. The end credits also do a great job of referencing deep cuts in the Barbie lineup.Diversity is on full display here & it works to the film's advantage. Girls & women watching this film will find a Barbie that looks like them. And gents, they didn't forget you either. There are also diverse Kens in Barbieland. In fact, I'm going to have trouble watching Kingsley Ben-Adir in Secret Invasion as Gravik, because he makes a great Ken. The whole point is representation. Barbie can be anything. The movie does a great job of driving that home.The marketing mentioned if you loved Barbie or hated Barbie, this is the movie for you. It doesn't shy away from Barbie's detractors. Gloria's daughter delivers a scathing referendum on Barbie's impact on society. But later on Gloria delivers a monologue that had my whole theater cheering when she finished. As a middle aged woman, I related to everything she said. I didn't find it preachy as some have said. It felt heartfelt & reflective of what most women deal with every single day.It's fun. At times, it's plain old goofy. The dance numbers are on point. I don't know what I was expecting but I walked out of the theater still chuckling.It's okay to revel in the fun of it. It's okay to dive into the deeper themes. There were tons of ""Barbies"" & ""Kens"" in my theater, wearing their favorite shade of pink, be it subtle or neon. The fans are all in & even a reluctant movie goer like me can get on board. Lots of laughs with enough real world to make it relatable. One of the better movies I've seen in a very long time.No post credits sequences.",Barbie

I also found myself looking at the time hoping it would be over soon. They preached that this movie was for ""everyone"" & am so thankful that there weren't any children in the theater when I saw it because I do not think it was appropriate for younger aged kiddos.Will still always love Barbie & Margot Robbie just wish this would've been better!",Barbie
4.0,A case study of when something is so hyped up that it is impossible to disappoint,sepehrizadi-55573,24 July 2023,"Frankly I was incredibly disappointed. Nolan at his best captures his audience with incredible cinematography, sound and, most importantly, narrative. Oppenheimer has incredible cinematography and sound, but lacks sorely in narrative. The actors did what they could, which I might say was a fantastic job, but Nolan simply couldn't keep focus on a few but compelling narratives, but instead shot off in all kinds of directions with multiple plots. It caused an incredibly exhausting and, dare I say, boring experience. Let's make something clear; a movie has to first and foremost be entertaining and then it can layer the entertainment with visuals and sounds. Oppenheimer did it the other way around, except the entertaining part never actually arrived.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Surprisingly good,Jeremy_Urquhart,23 July 2023,"I think part of my brain rejects this for being a feature-length toy commercial, but it's a very small part of my brain (and that really wasn't where my mind was for the majority of the movie).Overall, it's probably about as good as an official live-action Barbie movie could ever be, with Greta Gerwig clearly given plenty of freedom to have fun with a property/movie like this. It's bigger in scale than her previous two films (Ladybird and Little Women, both of which I prefer to this by a little), and the scale and creativity of the film really kept the momentum going. It's very funny in parts, and though I guess it's sort of a kid-friendly movie, there are tons of jokes and references that'll go over the heads of younger kids. ""What's a fascist?"" is something I heard a four-year-old ask one of their parents halfway through the movie, and that in itself was kind of funny to hear.Margot Robbie is good as always, and is given a surprising amount to do emotionally. It is Barbie's movie, but Ryan Gosling's Ken often steals the film whenever he's on-screen (as the film's wrapping up, there's a fairly awkward pivot to ""oh yeah, this is Barbie's movie;"" it's even addressed in dialogue). I don't think that's a problem, because he's hilarious - it might be one of the best performances he's ever given. I also don't think his character is used ""just"" to attack men, the way I imagine some people will read into it. Barbie does the most learning and has the biggest character arc, sure, but Ken goes through one too, and I thought they wrapped up that side of things nicely.It's an enjoyable movie that deals with some hefty topics (namedropping plenty of words younger kids won't have even heard before) in a mostly consistent way. Some tonal shifts are jarring, and while the vast majority of jokes land, I don't think all did. It does also feel a bit too directly like a commercial at a couple of points, especially early on, but I did expect that. And it's a testament to the quality of the movie that me and all my anti-consumerist thoughts didn't overpower my mind throughout most of this.",Barbie

The acting is commendable especially the acting of Cillian Murphy and Emily blunt. The personal and professional life of Oppenheimer is portrayed beautiful. And the Mastermind behind all this Christopher Nolan again gives us a Masterpiece which will be talked about till decades. At last everyone should experience this movie and that to in cinema theaters because this movie is made for that and on a TV, laptop,mobile etc screen will not give you the perfect experience.",Oppenheimer
3.0,"Great sets, great execution but horrible storyline",DaHermitKid,28 July 2023,"Firstly, the technical execution is top notch. Great attention to detail both costume and sets.Ryan Gosling is by far the the best and delivers an excellent performance as the foolish Ken. The others do a good job as well.But this movie's overall messaging is horrible. It paints an entire group of people (the Kens) as purposeless and existing only to serve the superior Barbies. Plus, any movie that unironically talks about ""the patriarchy"" is automatically cringe. Parents with children especially boys should think hard about what message they are sending their kids when they see this movie.",Barbie
4.0,Way too preachy,gianthaole,23 July 2023,"My wife and I did the double feature of Barbie and Oppenheimer. Barbie started off strong and Ryan Gosling is very funny in the movie. The problem is none of the Barbies are in a comedy. This movie should have been 90 minutes of comedy. It maybe could have had a simple heartfelt moment between a mom and her daughter but this movie has several preachy moments that made me wonder, who is this movie for? Little girls won't enjoy this, teenage girls won't enjoy this, adult women won't enjoy this. So who is the target audience? Who are the preachy moments for?

9.0,Cillian Murphy's best performance to date.,flongalesamy,25 July 2023,"There are movies that transcend mere entertainment, and ""Oppenheimer"" is undoubtedly one of them. Directed by the brilliant Christopher Nolan, this three-hour masterpiece is a breathtaking display of pure art, paying a splendid modern tribute to the grandeur of Hollywood's golden era. Nolan's craftsmanship is at its pinnacle, complemented by a 5-star cast featuring Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and Emily Blunt.Cillian Murphy's portrayal of the troubled and complex character, Robert Oppenheimer, is an exceptional achievement and his best performance to date. With ease, Murphy makes Oppenheimer remarkably relatable to the audience, tracing his journey from a young, uncertain man to an accomplished scientist who would reshape the course of history.Special mention to the performances of Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss and Matt Damon as General Groves, both of whom add depth and intensity to the narrative.I'd also like to salute Nolan's commitment to historical accuracy, purposefully avoiding CGI to render the experience as realistic as possible, despite minor blemishes (like the appearance of a incorrect American flag.)Ludwig Göransson's work on the film's soundtrack is a standout aspect, adding an emotional dimension to the film and making the experience truly unforgettable.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is another cinematic masterpiece by Nolan that deserves every accolade and recognition it receives. This film is a testament to the power of cinema, and is already solidifying its place among the all-time greats in the history of cinema.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Another Feather in Christopher Nolan's Hat,asayed-63121,23 July 2023,"Oppenheimer is a movie which is not interested in showing any combat sequences of World War II, but instead focuses on the politics and the invention of the bomb that was supposed to end all wars. It is also an exploration of guilt of Oppenheimer as well as the petty politics behind the scene.Cillian Murphy completely steals the show and guarantees himself an Academy nod. He perfectly captures the guilt of the scientist. There are dialogues which gave me genuine chills. Robert Downey is also brilliant in his performance. He completely sheds his Iron Man persona to the point where he is almost unrecognizable. He steps into the shoes of Levi Strauss. In a certain way, this might be his magnum opus. Other actors like Matt Damon, Rami Malek, Florence Pugh also contribute to the movie in their own brilliant ways.I was a big fan of the cinematography of the film. Even though I couldn't watch it in IMAX, the visuals of the movie still managed to mesmerize me. The camera beautifully captures the scenic view of Los Alamos. The sound design also complements the film, as the sound of explosion has a tendency to horrify you.The dialogues in the film are a treat to anyone who enjoys a film for the conversation rather than big set pieces. The opining line itself would be mentioned in the zeitgeist for years to come. The dialogues also helps to bring the nuances of each character and also refuses to insult the intelligence of its audience, trusting the viewer to know about the intricacies and doesn't dumb it down for them.Lastly I want to praise the horrifying visuals in certain sequences, which brilliantly captures the horrors of war, and does justice to the victims of World War 2. Even though it doesn't have any combat sequences, the visuals still can terrify you, and could basically be the source of envy for many horror directors.However, the runtime is too exhausting, making it unsuitable for repeated viewings. After the dropping of the bombs, the courtroom drama takes too much of the runtime, instead of tying everything up in a neat bow.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Best cinema experience,Iazman,22 July 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" is an exceptional movie that captivates its audience with its compelling storytelling, brilliant performances, and breathtaking cinematography. The film masterfully portrays the life and achievements of J. Robert Oppenheimer, shedding light on his pivotal role in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. With a thought-provoking narrative and a deep exploration of ethical dilemmas, it leaves viewers pondering the consequences of scientific discoveries. Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" is a must-see film that brilliantly captures the complexities of history and the human condition.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Mature humour mixed with absolutely beautiful scenes,UnusualKmc,22 July 2023,"Barbie lives in a perfect world.When she discovers the real world, she realises that people age, have depression, family issues, and do not see the world as a perfect place that they want to be in everyday.This theme of Barbie coming to terms with what it means to be a human, with both the lows and the highs, is what leads to some truly beautiful scenes that make the room freeze. I saw the movie in a packed venue, a couple hundred people all munching crisps and children rustling and asking questions.During these scenes, everything was silent. No one moved, ate, or talked.As for the rest of the movie, it was great. If you're just looking for a good movie, this is one. Plenty of humour and the soundtrack is amazing, an instant save on Spotify. The dance sequences, especially the ones with Ken, are a feast for the eyes. The movie touches on the idea that you dont have to be perfect or the best. You dont have to be a lawyer/doctor, or a celebrity, or a nobel prize winner. There is nothing worng with just being average.The only thing stopping me from rating higher is a personal itch with the movie - the main part of the movie is Barbie dealing with a male dominated society (patriarchy) and all the issues women face in that. I don't mind the concept, but after the movie I wished that wasn't the main focus. It would have been a masterpiece 10/10 of a movie if it had focused on the problems of the human soul (sadness, loss, regret) and the joys of human life (raising a child, friends, finding happiness in the worst places) instead of ""boys vs girls"".Lastly, I would recommend a word of caution for any parents taking children to see it - it is rated a 12+ (at least in the UK) and thats solely due to the sexual undertones and jokes thrown around. Nothing terrible, but could be slightly uncomfortable.The hype surrounding the movie paid off, I'm glad I watched it.",Barbie
2.0,The most political movie I've ever seen.,mayaaaaaaaaaaa,21 July 2023,"I loved the effort with the sets and the fun outfits. I also really enjoyed the ads threw out movie.I was really enjoying this movie but then it started getting really political, I was kind of fine with it but then they started making politics the whole story line and so it was really no longer a fun movie. After the movie finished I just ended up leaving miserable and like I waisted money... How is a family meant to enjoy this?? I can't see any 13 year old understanding anything they talk about.Also they want to talk about how being a human is hard and that were not perfect but then they hire someone to play a teen girl who has perfect hair and skin. A bit of a confusing message?",Barbie
10.0,Such a lovely film,rockettbootz,20 July 2023,"I absolutely loved the barbie movie, the movie had such a beautiful message and Margot is just exceptional.The world is so colourful , the characters are all fantastic.A great film for any barbie fan.Kate McKinnon and America Ferrera are stand outs as well.There will be people who cast judgment for the sake of being negative but I truly, genuinely think that most will enjoy this film.The full cast of the film are just perfect.Go check them it out, take your friends and make a night of it , can guarantee you will absolutely enjoy yourself.Will definitely see it again and can't wait for the DVD. Hope there is a stack of special features.",Barbie
3.0,Nudity wasn't necessary,nadkison,28 July 2023,"Had it not been for the nudity, I would have loved this movie. So disappointed in the decision to lower such standards for trashy scenes. We can understand that people are nude without actually having to view it. Several of us saw the movie together and agreed the nudity was completely uncalled for. Don't we get enough of society trying to shove that junk down our throats? Just adding to the problem of too many hormones running around to the point of affecting children and all the human trafficking problems. So disappointed in this film and it's director and producers. It could have been such an amazing film.",Oppenheimer
10.0,One of Christopher N. best movies to date.,rynesmith-49874,26 July 2023,"Other then interstellar and inception, I can genuinely say this is one of his best movies hes made so far. The amount of detail put into the movie was amazing and I love the film/editing effects he did to convey or portray a setting or time or place. It was a long movie, 180 minutes of runtime but honestly when it was over I turned to the person I was with and told them I wanted to see it again and they said the same thing. Also we couldn't help whisper to each other at parts because sometimes i can be a little tough to follow with all the historical figures. Would recommended everyone go and see it to see the dilemma he lived with. He did the right thing but he also created a much dangerous world.",Oppenheimer
8.0,It's Actually Fun to Be in a Barbie World,ajacayen-90247,20 July 2023,"Going into Barbie with having little to no expectations at all can be such a delight.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's banter with one another, even when they are on their own, are so entertaining to look at, especially Gosling who seems to have a more fun in the movie and is indeed the funniest out of all the cast members.That being said, everyone in the cast seem to be having fun in their own respective roles, living out Barbieland and the real world. But by far the standout would have to Kate McKinnon (Ghostbusters) and America Ferrera (How To Train Your Dragon), who both help Robbie's titular character when she is having an existential crisis.As for the production design, it is without a doubt, the strongest aspect of the film, particularly in BarbieLand where it seemed like the production team really went all-out in making the world, not to mention how they really feel when young girls are playing with Barbie.The film does carry a lot of themes of not just someone trying to overcome an identity loss but also how acceptance should start by loving yourself and not needing to live up to the norms set up by leaders.They are thought-provoking including capitalist feminism (how ideas can make money instead of enjoyment), alongside the idea of growing up which is coming to terms with reality and letting go of the childhood you have cherished - which is well-represented in the fantasy and real world.All the way through, as a comedy, even though some jokes did not land well, most of it are really funny and does put a smile on your face up until the very end.Overall, Barbie continues to prove the amazing directing skills of Greta Gerwig (Little Women, Lady Bird) and alongside her writing craft with her husband Noah Baumbach. With this film alongside Oppenheimer, it is one of the standout films of 2023.",Barbie
10.0,"Spoiler free) Nolan's Masterpiece, it just wont be appreciated by all",mitchsimon-35366,21 July 2023,"When the credits began to roll, I was speechless. An incredibly fast paced and stressful 3 hours flew by in what felt like an episode of television. I felt almost a sour taste in my mouth, and wanted to go curl up in a ball under my covers. My heart was still racing and mentally I was exhausted. A lot of my hope was gone. Still, my main thought was ""unbelievable. I have just witnessed Nolan's masterpiece."" Long has Nolan been a director I admire for his technical accuracy, complex topics, and what he reveals about humanity. This film was no different than his previous films in attention to soundtrack, visual affects, and filmography. Without the use of a big twist like in inception and the prestige, he still left a meaningful end impact.Now, to address the title as to why it won't be appreciated. Like any semi-causal moviegoer, I instantly went to the reviews to see how others felt. Large criticisms were the dialogues were too complex, the trinity test too small, and overall a boring film. I chalk those reviews up to the type of people who watch a movie for only a dopamine release. I say that not in a pretentious way, but in a way as to why I thought this film beats the dark knight or other films. All I wanted to do after this film was debate and read more about this obviously flawed yet important man. The world I have lives in was challenged and I no longer felt as safe as before. This was marketed as a blockbuster must see, and while that is true that everyone should watch it for its obvious important matter, the satisfaction a moviegoer will derive is lessened if they are not ready to be confused and want to learn more after.If you want an action movie, this is not for you. If you want a quick flick, I would definitely not recommend this. If you want to be challenged and stressed in ways that movies such as Inception, The prestige, Fight Club, Whiplash, and many more, then I couldn't recommend this movie more. I watched in UltraAVX and just bought weekend tickets for IMAX.",Oppenheimer
10.0,PERFECT,venompool-68826,26 July 2023,"At the beginning, it cleverly reflects social issues through gender reversal, but not merely as a reversal. Both gender groups retain their essence, and the ending isn't about one group's victory over the other, but about working together. It encompasses not only gender equality but also recognition and acceptance of others and oneself. It's not about feminism, patriarchy, or gender confrontation. It's not about stereotypes or perfectionism. It's about gender equality, embracing individuality, and mutual understanding. This movie isn't exclusively for women; it showcases the fierce presentation of chuunibyou (middle school syndrome) in both genders. Outstanding performances and dance sequences keep the entire film engaging without clichés.",Barbie
5.0,Murphy is great but Nolan is not,mitraayan-71614,21 July 2023,"There is a famous Einstein quote: ""If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."" In my opinion Nolan failed to explain it simply. Oh don't get me wrong I loved Inception, Interstellar and Dunkirk even though TBH I didn't understand Interstellar fully.I had great expectations from Oppenheimer, I wanted to watch it first day as it is about Manhattan project and Nolan made it. But I am disappointed as the move is all over the place. It fails to catch audiences' attention throughout the film, even I wanted to focus and try to understand but the movie was all over place. There is no doubt Cillian , RDJ, Emily and others were great in the movie, they are all great actors, but according to me the movie the fell short of what we expect of Nolan. From Nolan we expect our intellect joy and mind blown but nothing happened as such instead I got bored in few scenes.",Oppenheimer
1.0,"very good movie, very entertaining",gehete-40949,24 July 2023,"Barbie is one of the best movies that has come out in recent history. It has great casting, great story, great acting, great music. It is a movie about being a strong female role model and having belief in yourself. Margot robbie is gorgeous, Ryan Gosling is funny and all the side characters do an excellent job at contributing getting very positive messages across.I cried several times and laughed at every joke because it all worked wonderfully. I wish people would make more of these movies as they really make the world a better place. There is not one thing bad about this movie. I wish I could find a way to improve it but it is just perfect.",Barbie
10.0,She's everything! He's just Ken.,Reviews2u,29 July 2023,"Fantastic movie! The writing and storyline is so much deeper than I could have imagined for a Barbie movie. I loved this movie so much that I saw it twice opening week and plan to buy it once it hits streaming. I think women and girls of all ages will love it. I know plenty of guys who like it as well. It's smart, funny, clever, deep, thoughtful, etc. I was actually in tears during the America Ferrera monolog. These actors are all amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling were the perfect Barbie and Ken. The music was amazingly hilarious. The Ken battle scene cracked me up so much. Greta Gerwig is a phenomenal. I loved her version of Little Women and this is every bit as good. Barbie is a must see. Don't wait, go see it now!",Barbie
1.0,Waste of time this is boring movie,biyanideepesh,24 July 2023,"The film is a dull and tedious affair, with no sense of drama, emotion or insight. Nolan's direction is uninspired and bland, relying on clichés and exposition to tell a story that has been told better before. The cast is wasted, with no chemistry or charisma. The film is also too long, dragging on for nearly three hours, with no tension or excitement. People were literally sleeping in the hall, and I don't blame them. Oppenheimer is a disappointing and boring film that does not do justice to its subject or its audience. It is a waste of time and money. I give it one star out of five. I regret wasting my time.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Nolan's most unique movie!!,akhiranandanp,28 July 2023,"It's hard to articulate all the thoughts, but y'all remember when we used to be kids and watched Batman and lived the character for a few days? Cillian Murphy had a similar impact on me. Ludwig Göransson's score was perfect and will not let you miss Hans Zimmer. Screenwriting is something Christopher Nolan has mastered since Memento. Can we call Oppenheimer Nolan's best work? I'd say no! But this will be considered a film that is unique from the other films he has made. Can we call it Cillian Murphy's best role? A big yes! Because of the superhero movies, we often forget how great an actor Robert Downey is. As Lewis Strauss, he blew everyone's mind! Magnificent actors, Incredible storytelling and Engaging music. A simple 8/10. The only complaint is the run time. I felt like 15 mins from the court room drama can be trimmed.",Oppenheimer
10.0,"A moving, compelling film",3films,26 July 2023,"A compelling, eye opening story. As well as incredibly visually appealing in its 70mm glory, for a movie that was majority talking there was never a dull moment. The actors were fantastic. Cillians eyes showed everything and portrayed emotions the real J Robert Oppenheimer showed in real footage phenomenally. The movie felt like a thriller and had me on the edge of my seat in some scenes. The score was also incredible and presented so many emotions that's created moods and tension throughout the film. For the first time in a while I left the theatre speechless and moved and this movie really got me thinking. Once again Christopher Nolan has created a terrific film.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Exceeded expectations,keeppounding,23 July 2023,"I had high hopes for this film and have been looking forward to it for about a year. I was blown away by the level of humor, the emotion, the meaning, everything! Honestly, it should've been called Ken, as Ryan Gosling stole the show. I've always thought that he was underrated as a comedic actor. He was Ken. He owned it. He deserves awards for completely giving himself over to the character. Having said that, the entire cast was awesome. The music was incredible. The set design was perfect. I laughed and cried throughout. I didn't expect all of the feels, but there were so many messages that touched my heart. I look forward to many more viewings.",Barbie
8.0,An absolute showstopper from Cillian Murphy,dtqcjcrss,22 July 2023,"Cillian utterly steals the show with his performance in this narrative heavy, fast paced drama. He portrays the emotional fragility and genius of a remarkably complicated man outstandingly.The film itself is as time jumping as you come to expect from a Nolan film and you will not be alone if you feel a little lost and perplexed at points, however the film making is a masterclass in authentic genuine production and the use of IMAX for awe inspiring benefitAt times I felt the balance of volume between music and dialogue meant it difficult to understand, perhaps another watch at home will open my eyes to the story in more understanding, but don't get me wrong- this is a film you MUST see as it was intended, on as large a screen as possible.And finally, the film opened my eyes to just what a terrifying thing man created and what devastating end we could all be so close to. I'm certainly not pro UND but it does make you think a little deeper.",Oppenheimer

His directing here is top notch.The movie seamlessly goes through different phases of the story. Cillian Murphy... well i dont have words to describe his performance. S definite oscsr contender.

10.0,Just WOW,abdullahosmirza,21 July 2023,"My first ever movie review and thank god it's Oppenheimer. Was so invested in it who knew 3 hours had gone by. We talk about Murphy but damn RDJ was exceptional. Well that's on the acting front and Nolan is Nolan, adopted this biopic into it's own style excellently with great character. Each character playing its role brilliantly. And THAT trinity test, wow that was one to watch. You were forced to keep your eye on the screen just so that you might not miss something. Surely will go down as one of the iconic scenes. Now what do I even say about the score every scene had its own mood and complementing each moment exquisitely. Wow. What more can I just say just don't know. This is surely one not to miss.",Oppenheimer
8.0,The Power To Destroy The World,MisterJxroen,20 July 2023,"Me and a few of my friends saw Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" on opening night, in the IMAX format for which this film was intended. The feeling I have after having watched this film is something I can't really describe, nor do I know how I feel about the film as a whole. I feel as if this movie doesn't directly try to tell you whether or not Oppenheimer was a good or bad person, but allows one to decide this for their own. Same with the dilemma of building such a weapon of mass destruction.I think the visual portrayal of the atomic bomb was magnificent. The buildup to this moment was nerve-wrecking and really put me on the edge of my seat. And when it finally happened; quietness. It was the silence before the storm. For a moment, we get to see the beauty of it, and then we are hit with all the destruction and pain that can come with it; the shockwave. And I felt it coming too!We as an audience get to see it mostly from Oppenheimer's perspective, as I understand it. He doesn't look at the grand scale of it, but instead seems to recognize his dreams (and nightmares) in this phenomenon; the atoms and molecules floating around in harmony, just like he envisioned.I disliked the frequent and abrupt cutting between scenes and missed some prolonged, quieter scenes. Lee Smith's (previous editor for Nolan) absence is definitely felt throughout the film. This film also misses another genius who has frequently partnered with Nolan; Hans Zimmer. Though the soundtrack isn't on his level, Ludwig Göransson managed to deliver a beautiful score full of emotion and suspense. I'm yet to listen to it on Spotify since it hasn't released yet, but I know it'll be a great listen.The acting was splendid from every star that featured in this film-which were a lot. Cillian Murphy in the lead role is obviously a standout, and I wouldn't be surprised if this role lands him a lead actor Oscar (nomination). Another standout for me personally is Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Lewis Strauss. I don't know anything about Strauss, but Robert felt like an amazing fit for the role.I don't know how much of this story is completely factual, but I was intrigued and interested by it nonetheless. I can't wait to do more research about the subject matter, just like I can't wait to learn about how Nolan managed to make this film without CGI. I'm still processing this film, so for now my rating remains at a solid eight stars. Definitely an incredible thrill that one must face on the big screen.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Disappointingly awesome film.,vladlenf,24 July 2023,"Had another look at the Barbie film. The first impression is undoubtedly a great colourful story of Barbie finding herself in the world. But if you watch it again, more thoughtfully, opening your heart and mind, I'm afraid you will leave the cinema devastated and crushed.I won't retell the plot, but it hides a horrifying reality of the modern world that even the authors didn't have in mind.The film Barbie, was supposed to be an ode to liberal feminism, but I saw a different reality. Barbie's character is not at all central to the story. The film is not about her. The film shows the dismal state of men in a society where everything revolves around vaginas (I'm not saying that, it's from the film). There the film ends with that, literally a vagina. But that's not my point. The authors, without realising it themselves, bring Ken's dramatic story to the forefront. It's Ken who wants to change for the better, not silly Barbie. It's Ken who literally changes his life through his quest to find himself in the world. This is Ken overcoming himself. It's Ken who is talented, resourceful, and driven. And what does Barbie do? She's like a capricious girl who just goes with the flow. She doesn't want change. She's satisfied with the monotonous course of her life: chatting with everyone and partying in the evening.Unfortunately Ken, in love with Barbie, does not fit in with her meaningless existence in any way. Ken ends up building ""his own amusement park, with blackjack and hookers."" Everything was great there, everyone was happy there, everyone was happy, until Barbie came along and through blatant treachery broke it again. Ken very accurately said then that in this world unfortunately there is only Barbie and next to her Ken, there is no just Ken. Just happy Ken. He was trapped in the idiotic world of vaginas. A world where it's proclaimed that all men are fools and women are goddesses reflexive about every fucking thing.Gotta hand it to the makers, Ken's musical episode is the best thing I've ever seen on film lately. Definitely on the list of best films of the year. Disappointingly awesome film.",Barbie
4.0,Disappointing telling of the most important event in history,rich-106,28 July 2023,"Like some of the director's other films, but this was a directorial and editing disaster. I saw the 70mm IMAX version, but the IMAX big-screen features were not used well in this film. It wasn't necessary to see it on a big screen. You would think the bomb scene would make use of the screen, but it was a dud.The film uses extensive flash-forwards and flashbacks, as well as black-and-white and color sequences. Both techniques were unnecessary and confusing, but that seems to be the current fad.The first hour and a half of the film is mostly about politics and investigators, which is not my interest in this story. I wanted to know about how the bomb was built. That part of the story takes up about an hour, and it was made as dull as possible. Then we are left with more investigations of people in small rooms for half an hour at the end.The script was mediocre, leaving not much for the actors to do. Some gratuitous sex was thrown in, for no reason that I could discern. The opening apple story likely never happened in real life. It's ridiculous to think so. Over 20 people at Los Alamos gave their lives in the process of making the bomb, and they aren't mentioned at all. Some died from radiation poisoning. Einstein's letter to FDR, which started it all, is not mentioned at all.The movie spends way too much time on the boring Strauss character. I guess it was because of who played him. The movie is just a hodgepodge of scenes jumping from times and places, slapped together without much thought to a story arc. It should have been a great thriller.",Oppenheimer
8.0,"I mean, Barbir is really an everything.",Ae_Sutthiphon,26 July 2023,"As someone said, this is a bittersweet pill. A film that intends to be entertainment and toy marketing, but somehow, it brought tears out of my eyes.I love it. I love everything about it. I love everything it represents: identity crisis, toxic masculinity, and glorifying the value of dolls. Greta Gerwig took an idea that seemed outdated, like ""Barbie,"" to tell a vivid contemporary story. At the very same time, the film also teases itself and all sorts of pop culture. And all the productions-oh my, they are all very pleasing to my eyes and ears.Some that I'm stuck on are the half-jokes/half-seriously tone, which makes the final act not as powerful as it should be. The overexplaining of characters, when they said everything they thought but didn't really show it in another way, and Ken's arc are not completely closure to me.In the end, Billie Eilish's song is the key to winning my heart. Man, that song and that scene are so beautiful.",Barbie
10.0,this is the movie of humanity,nsbsnvp,20 July 2023,"I watched this over the weekend and I can say downright that all the media attention and acclaim this movie has received is all truthful. This is a dark-gritty, wholesome and unconventionally humorous film that creates a dark and twisted yet fantastical and feminine adjunction towards the brand and the key themes it lays upon, themes of feminism, social roles, corporate greed, aging, legacies and divine intervention. It reads like a piece from epic poetry, as if the gods themselves had come down and made it. This is definitely the movie of 2023, and the wide range of actors just make it more convincing, I had my boyfriend drooling over ryan reynolds for the duration of the movie and I loved Margot Robbie's take on barbie. Loved this movie.",Barbie

3.0,Inappropriately loud and fast paced for what should have been a quiet boardroom drama,fruity_dictator,23 July 2023,"So I'll take the contrarian view here and say Oppenheimer is basically kind of bad. I don't think we'd be seeing these sorts of reviews if the movie was promoted or hyped up less. Very sad but true. I did my best to conceal my serious disappointment while I was at the theatre, didn't want to seem a party pooper. I went to the theater hoping I was going to be watching a genuine revival of Hollywood or something along those lines- that I would lean away from speed, colour, and volume, just a little bit back towards pacing, character, narrative. I understand it is a blockbuster film, I was just hoping the needle would move somewhat in the other direction of the general trend in a film such as this. No such luck.What we do in fact get is a basically relentless exposition dump scored to the Inception soundtrack. The main character doesn't have much character, the supporting characters don't have enough air to breathe after all the rapid-fire delivery of exposition and information about what's going on to develop personalities of their own on screen, for the most part. The soundtrack is indeed relentless and I began to suspect that it was so constant in order to cover up the fact that there's not really much of any narrative tension in the movie.If you go watch this in theatres you will find yourself occasionally buffeted by explosive walls of sub-bass at peculiar times (the actual detonation of the bomb is actually one of the quieter explosions in the movie).I think what bothers me the most is that there is so much budget, so much acting talent, loaded into this movie. And for all the resources allocated to this project, the result is basically uninspiring, emotionally flat, basically attempting to buffet you into having a reaction through momentum. It shouldn't be like this considering the movie's subject matter ie, people talking in labs, boardrooms, over glasses of wine, in lecture halls. It's just not the right way to film this sort of plot.You've already seen it, I'm sure you liked it, but for me, it's a sore disappointment and shows that Hollywood cannot really do it anymore.Final gripe: seeing Oppenheimer reclining in his La -Z-Boy in the nude after smoking hot sex is extremely stupid, but also funny.

7.0,It's A Good Movie. How Good IS HArd To Say.,tzer0,29 July 2023,"Oppenheimer isn't a bad movie. It's a good movie. It's just difficult to know just how good it is since the dialogue is constantly interrupted either by over the top sound effects or a self important and intrusive soundtrack by Ludwig Göransson. It isn't that Christopher Nolan thinks he's Michael Bay. There's only one explosion, but it is a big one. It's just that he might as well have been Michael Bay, exchanging explosions on the screen for an explosive soundtrack. I don't know if Ludwig Göransson thinks he's the new Vangelis or the next Hans Zimmer, but he is neither. They must have a great sound system in the studio's mixing room. It's just too bad the average Cineplex can't quite match it.I think he would have been better served if he had brought Zimmer onboard to do the soundtrack. He brought other people from the Batman movies. Gary Oldman is almost unrecognizable as President Harry Truman and Tom Conti is totally unrecognizable as Professor Albert Einstein. There are other Hollywood Heavyweights in other cameos as well. But they're all overshadowed by the intrusive overbearing soundtrack.If only Christopher Nolan had more respect for the audiences intelligence he might have given the dialogue a more prominent place in his film. Quantum Mechanics and Nuclear Physics are difficult enough subjects to tackle when you can hear and understand every word being said clearly and distinctly. But when you have music that is trying to create a sense of urgency and tension even in scenes where there is none, it's a bit like the snow he inserts into scenes where it isn't cold enough to see the actors breath. Obviously he is foreshadowing nuclear winter and fallout, but again, it's as intrusive as the persistent soundtrack, and more than a little ham-handed. Muck like the inserted nudity and sex scene trying to allude to Oppenheimer's life being laid bare before his detractors.Cillian Murphy's performance is excellent. Had this film been made a decade or two ago his part might well have gone to Peter Weller. He would have fit right in as the Doctor Buckaroo Banzai of the 1940s, especially when Naked Lunch like sexual and atomic hallucination intrude into the story almost as much as that bombastic soundtrack.Perhaps all the blasts of music, sound effects and shocking imagery are to keep the audience awake since you can't always hear the dialogue. Or, maybe, he thought the dialogue itself would put people to sleep, especially after the bomb is made and shipped off to Japan and the movie is only a little more than half over and the film degenerates into a courtroom drama against Oppenheimer by a Robert Downey Jr.'s bitter character, since it's filled enough science and political science to put the audience to sleep even with the intrusive music and hallucinations. It's hard to say for certain since I couldn't hear a lot of it.So I hope when the DVD comes out there will be instead of a Director's Cut, a Viewer's Cut, complete with options like a soundtrack that can be turned down. At least there will be Closed Captions, hopefully accurate ones, and not like the ones that seem be written for the deaf by the deaf. No, good ones where you can read what's actually being said. Only then will I be able to determine just how good this good movie really was. It was certainly better than the theater's sound system as it struggled to keep up. Perhaps they should resurrect the of Sensurround System from the 1970's that they used for movies like Earthquake and Midway with enough Cervwin-Vega speakers for a Grateful Dead concert. Maybe that would allow the audience to hear the dialogue above the intrusive score and atomic blasts. Otherwise it's like trying to watch a combination of a dramatic Broadway play with the entire New York Philharmonic on stage with the actors, punctuating their every line with fanfares and flourishes.Does this review seem overly long and monotonous? Well then Oppenheimer probably isn't your cup of tea. The ""courtroom stuff"" makes the ""math stuff"" seem interesting by comparison. It seems that Christopher Nolan wanted to give us an epic. It's certainly long enough to be one. But most of the film isn't IMAX worthy, even if the soundtrack requires their sound system. This could have been a Smart Movie, but I think Nolan made it just smart enough for intellectually challenged pretentious people to think it is. Or maybe I'm wrong and it's just me. But if I were you, I'd wait for the DVD, or Stream it. That way you can rewind missed dialogue and take breaks as needed in order to find out.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Oppenheimer is a masterpiece....but,ahmedlightocon,20 July 2023,"I watched it on imax and This is one if not the best theatre experience that I've ever scene and i think at least you should watch it on a really biggest screen as possible because believe me this is a truly another experience that may have not seen before nolan storytelling on it's peak but I understand that this film may be not everyone cup of tea So don't be fool by any review you see You must watch it and make your own thoughts about it.Nolan gives us a biographical film but by his own way The film is such a horror and horrible in a good way , the impact that leaved me after watching it. Just a SHOCK It's not just a great movie it's really beyond that One of the most important film in this century . We are experiencing the consequences , fears, and dilemmas of the events narrated in the story so far.",Oppenheimer
10.0,New concept,juuljuulbees,20 July 2023,"Iconic. The set, the outfits, the decor, the styling was iconic. I loved that the words and tones they used were as if a child was playing with them, but the topics were more serious and meaningful. They gave such a creative and fun spin to everything. I had many moments where I thought ""how did they even come up with all of this"". I like to be positively surprised in a movie and the conversations and jokes were so fun and fitting to the movie and the vibe, everything was well thought of and I could not help but smile every time. It's very extravagant and light and fun. It's not a movie for people who like deep dialogues and dramatic emotions in films. It is meant to be easy to digest, fun, extra and make you smile. I find it a brilliant concept and a refreshing, lightweight movie. I loved it. Very Girly and fun.In one word: iconic.",Barbie
10.0,Will anyone beat this at Oscars ..,michaelayush,24 July 2023,As a fan of both Cillian and Nolan sir ..this films brings the joy of watching a super grand historic saga in the cinema halls ... Oppenheimer has made me travel 250 kms for IMAX ...as i know if i miss this i will not be able to forgive myself .. This film not only makes u at the edge of the seat knowing all the outcomes but also makes ur ears focussed on the exceptional dialogues and bg score . Not forgetting the performance given by RDJ ..he has given one of the best performances in his career ...This film is not only a treat to watch but also shows how The Great Robert Oppenheimer was cheated by his own countrie's pitty politics .. People are saying this is a long movie but watching it never made me feel about the duration of this masterpiece.... and is one of the best casting made for each and every role ...I am sure about watching it again 😍,Oppenheimer
9.0,All best with two exception,ansakhadeo,22 July 2023,"Perfect Movie. All aspects. Political, social, emotional, historical everything is good. Except One scene where Bhagavad Gita quote with romantic shots. Totally disappointed.Another thing is, only theoretical aspects were shown. No single practical aspect or experiment was shown. Which was much needed.About Acting, RDJ, Murphy are exceptional actors. No personal presence of any actor. Movie takes audience bank in time. This movie is milestone and ideal for all other Directors.Unlashing every aspect of Oppenheimer as a person is phenomenal.All other things are fine. And I am waiting for another project of Nolan.",Oppenheimer
8.0,"Funny, genuine, emotional and pink.",bcummi,22 July 2023,"With some of the greatest casting seen in a film (looking at you, Alan), this film was bound to be an enjoyable watch. Maggot Robbie plays her role with a sense of misplaced optimism, anxiety and true ennui. She questions her place in a world she no longer understands and brings us with her to find out. Ryan Gosling goes on his own journey of self discovery, understanding and empathy. Incredible costumes, sets, choreography and songs are a joy to behold on the screen. Great Gerwig expertly navigates complex topics with warmth and compassion, making us all wonder if the power of Barbie can truly help to heal the real world.",Barbie
10.0,Fabulously done,mc-14633,20 July 2023,"So, I didn't have that much of a high expectation going in to see this because I really wasn't sure what is was going to be. I grew up playing Barbie's and have watched the animated films many times with my kids.The movie from start to finish is so thoughtfully executed. It's for everyone, but mainly young girls need to see this. It's a great reminder of how special we are as women and how special ALL of us are individually as a person and the life we get to experience.Another fantastic element is adding a very 90s feel to the film. You will laugh like you used to laugh when fun comedies would come out in theatre's years ago. I haven't seen just a good comedy with heart in years.I brought my 7yr old and we dressed up for it too. I wanted her to see me comfortable in my own skin and her as well and the film touches on that. It's suited for any age, regardless of the rating.I don't give high ratings like this to films usually, as I find small things usually that I wish had been addressed more... but not in Barbie. What a fun movie and a great time you'll have watching this in theatre (or at home) knowing it's your childhood come to life.",Barbie
3.0,Too bad,svnwgcjb,22 July 2023,"When there was nothing left to sell in the cinema, they started to put forward the imax wave.

1.0,From Hype to Reality,Kallimachos7,26 July 2023,"I would like to start by saying that Ryan Gosling delivers an impressive performance as Ken, truly standing out in the film with his remarkable portrayal. However, the movie doesn't quite meet the marketed expectations, opting for a more adult, satirical, and meta-commentary approach instead of the anticipated lighthearted comedy, which may make it less enjoyable for some who were expecting different things . The visuals and humor can be excessive at times, possibly detracting from the overall experience. Additionally, the movie's direct handling of its message , while thought-provoking, might polarize viewers.",Barbie
10.0,The one and only masterpiece,nirodhasilva,19 July 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" (Film, directed by Christopher Nolan, starring Cillian Murphy):Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic masterpiece that delves deep into one of the most crucial periods in history-the creation of the atomic bomb during World War II. With an unparalleled vision and storytelling prowess, Nolan takes the audience on an immersive journey, bringing to life the complexities and moral dilemmas faced by J. Robert Oppenheimer, brilliantly portrayed by the talented Cillian Murphy.The film's attention to historical accuracy and its meticulous recreation of the era is awe-inspiring. Nolan's direction is as gripping as ever, creating a sense of tension and urgency that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats throughout the movie. The use of practical effects and stunning visuals adds an unparalleled level of realism that transports the audience back in time.Cillian Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer is nothing short of remarkable. He effortlessly captures the inner turmoil of the scientist, torn between his loyalty to his country and the ethical implications of developing such a devastating weapon. Murphy's ability to convey complex emotions through nuanced expressions and dialogue makes him the perfect choice for the role.Nolan's signature nonlinear storytelling adds another layer of intrigue to the narrative, unfolding Oppenheimer's life in a non-chronological manner, revealing key events that shaped his character. The film's score, composed by Hans Zimmer, complements the storytelling beautifully, enhancing the emotional impact of every scene.""Oppenheimer"" is a thought-provoking film that goes beyond the historical context and addresses broader philosophical themes about the human condition and the responsibilities of scientists in the face of unprecedented power. It challenges the audience to reflect on the consequences of scientific advancements and the choices individuals make in critical moments of history.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that combines Christopher Nolan's directorial brilliance, Cillian Murphy's captivating performance, and a compelling historical narrative. This film will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on viewers, solidifying its place as one of the greatest achievements in modern cinema.",Oppenheimer
6.0,"A largely positive message, wrapped in a fun package but the execution could have been improved",ta-98251,23 July 2023,"Firstly, the marketing for Barbie was great. The cinema was full of people wearing Pink when I watched Barbie on Friday and Oppenheimer on Saturday.Greta Gerwig largely succeeded in creating a fun film that gets her message across although it sometimes became a bit heavy handed at the expense of the narrative and tempo of the Movie.Barbie takes on the noble cause of trying to undo the message portrayed by its early history, reposition the expectations of females (and Barbie dolls) and shine a light on the patriarchy which exists in our society. It's a movie based on a kids toy but aimed at an older demographic who can internalise these messages.The opening act was fantastic. We were introduced to a fantasy Barbie Land which is everything we could have hoped for. The set design in immense and filled with predominantly modern day Barbies living their dream life in Doll houses. Margot Robbie, who plays ''stereotypical Barbie' was made for the roll and Ryan Gosling is great as Ken. The supporting cast are also a lot of fun.In the second act we are given a cause to enter the Real World where we are introduced to Will Ferrall and the Mattel Corporation. They were the least interesting part of the movie. One of the main issue is that they weren't realistic and blurred the lines between the tone of Barbie Land and the real world. Whilst some of their jokes were funny a number of them missed, something that was true of the movie as a whole. We are also introduced to other real world characters who have a bigger role to play.In the third act, things pick up again as we are able to explore Barbie Land. We get an stand-off between competing ideologies which is largely entertaining and funny. In this act there are a number key moments which reinforce the message of the film followed by several resolutions which may or may not please the general audience. There are parts of this act which could have been done better especially when it comes to the overall workings of Barbie Land.Barbie teased being a simple movie about a doll and instead went for the bigger goal of being a strong feminist movie and calling out the patriarchy. Overall there is a lot of fun to be had with the Barbie movie. It aims to deliver a positive message to its core audience however this sometimes comes at the expense of the narrative and tempo of movie as a whole.I never imagined that there would be so many thoughts and discussion to have post a Barbie movie. If you are caught up in The Barbie hype it's worth seeing in the cinema otherwise watch it when it is released to the masses.",Barbie
6.0,Could it ever meet expectations?,watchitwombat,23 July 2023,"Barbie Movie Review She's a Barbie girl (who is having an existential crisis) in the Barbie world. Life isn't so fantastic. So she decides to head to the 'real world' with Ken because we've got everything sorted over here right?The film highlights the paradox that is Barbie... and owns it. It would seem that they wrote a pros and cons list and tackled every item on it. Was Barbie an astronaut before women were allowed credit cards? Yes. Has she perpetuated unachievable body image stereotypes? Yes. Do they address both of these issues and everything in between - 100%. Even Mattel, the makers of Barbie and this film, aren't safe, poking fun at their own lack of diversity hiring.The experience feels very intimate, getting up close with Margot Robbie. From the literal extreme close ups to the emotion she manages to give when bringing a kids toy to life. Robbie commits to the role but never comes across as ditzy or dumb, growing more with every scene.However Ryan Gosling doesn't shift out of cheeseball mode but clearly relishes the chance to ham it up as a Himbo.The narration from Helen Mirren, although brief, is one of the highlights. Punctuating moments with her dry British wit.The message of inequality is prevalent in every line of this film and although it's an extremely important message, it could have been done without bashing you over the head with it for 2 hours.Mums and Dads will love the nostalgia and the occasional double entendre. Girls and boys will have fun while hopefully absorbing her (not so subtle) message.By Nick @WatchItWombat.",Barbie

That includes cinematography, editing, sound mixing and visual effects.Speaking of performances Cillian is the MVP and he carries this dramatic endeavor brilliantly. I am hoping he wins the Best Actor award next year. Downey was the other one who was absolutely brilliant as a scheming senator. Rest of the cast were all good but did not stand out that much.

5.0,Slow down Nolan!,calcico_ice,21 July 2023,"This movie cramped too much story, even it's 3 hour run time is still not enough. It rushed every single scene with dialogues, dialoges, boom, moved on to the next scene, dialogues, next scene, boom, next scene, without letting the audience absorb or process the scene.It's like doing a marathon while holding an explosive diarrhea. This movie can't wait to see the finish line.Nolan should just focus the story about Oppenheimer and the bomb, leave the story about his communist past, his messy love life, his trial and that strauss rdj story. This is a movie not a documentary. Focus!Imagine if better filmmaker made this, like Paul Thomas Anderson, Scorsese, Coen bros or Dennis Villeneuve. They would focus the story and let the scenes breathe. Nolan is technically brilliant but he's just an artsy Michael bay. A noobie film snob favourite. People love to sniff his farts because it made them think they are snobby film connoisseurs.",Oppenheimer
8.0,A Rare Expensive Beast!,abs-ghosh,24 July 2023,"I tend to gravitate towards fiction more than fact. Never been a big fan of war, true events or biographies and I wasn't sure about this one, especially with its three hour run time. Besides Dunkirk (skipped it for obvious reasons) I have yet to be disappointed by any of his works and took a chance. Yes, I even liked Tenet...Robert J. Oppenheimer is often considered a controversial figure in the history of the US WWII. Dubbed as the father of the of the atomic bomb that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the title would begin to weight heavy around his neck as he would try to unsuccessfully appeal to the president against further use. Hailed as a hero and then eventually tried as a potential spy for the Soviets, his loyalty would come under question as the eventual regret of his achievement and his past dealings with the communist party is weaponized against him by someone fairly close to him but who?I went in expecting a non eventful history lesson but got a movie with a slight mystery, instead. I am happy to say in today's climate, where it has gotten increasingly hard to bank on well known actors and directors to deliver a good film, Nolan still remains a reliable source for quality. His penchant for presenting scenes out of order, a slow but intense build of music in the background and short and quick lines of dialogue managed to keep the pacing quite brisk despite the long runtime and the lack of any actual action of any kind, it is simply brilliant. Perhaps not seeing any of the trailers and looking at a handful of reviews might have tempered my expectations? Or maybe I just got lucky that I found it entertaining unlike some of the movie goers around me. Eitherway, I will point out while this movie is great, its not perfect. You do need to go in with a tempered expectations as it has no action sequence, a lot of talk of theory and calculations along with a court drama towards the end. If you are expecting any scenes of war or action, you will be disappointed. However, if you have slight interest in science and are only vaguely familiar with name and facts around Oppenheimer, there is a story with a slight twist this movie tells and its well worth the watch atleast once.Speaking of expectations, a lot of reviews seem to point out a certain singular moment as a caution and its possible that the version I saw had been edited but I have to ask 'WHERE WAS THE LONG GRATITOUS SEX SCENE??"" Was it the intense breathing as the camera slowly pans by a wall? The only signs of nudity was a brief seconds of Oppenheimer sitting in a chair with his legs crossed, having a conversation. If this is a cause for concern then we have definitely gone backwards from the days of the FCC censorship. Because the scene is less than thirty seconds and subtle in a way where you don't really take notice.",Oppenheimer

6.0,"Forget the advertising, it's a Barbie movie.",brenogualdani,20 July 2023,"With exagerated colors as promised, Greta Gerwig shows hers capacity to create a piece that's not like a bait for critics or those who love art cinema, but a commercial movie as deep as its's neccessary for it's time - except for it's publicity and public attraction. Besides it's reputed director, screenwriters, actors, references for great movies and the most popular artists composing it's soundtrack, the movie doesn't crave to be one masterpiece. Its just a regular movie that fulfills its role. Even with some metalanguage and self commentaries, it doesn't reach a self-awareness that makes this worthiest. The same works for it's social commentaries, that use strong words on the dialogues only to cover it's weakness of some social-revolutionary statement of it's own ideology. But that's ok and not something to demand on a dolls movie, right? Tho, the movie still have some high points like it's dinamicity, comedy, sensibility and editing. It will probably won, deservedly, the Oscar for best costume design. It's worthy what it's supposed to worth. It isn't what it selled it was supposed to worth.

10.0,I feel so seen- and that's what Barbie is!,zillizard,22 July 2023,"I continuously laughed and cried the whole movie. The acting is impeccable. There are so many small details and visual gags that I'm sure there were things I missed because I was laughing so much. It's clear the writers are intimately familiar with doll play, and how Barbies are actually used by children.Special shout-out to America Ferrara in this respect. Obviously Robbie and Gosling are amazing, but Ferrera brings the ""human woman"" perspective with enthusiasm and warmth. Her delivery for certain monologues is achingly relatable, and acknowledges issues facing both women and Barbie in a way that validates what women may or may not feel without judgement, just camaraderie.The movie is self aware, the auteur lens making it feel like you're watching alongside someone. I cannot imagine watching the movie and feeling alone- Greta gerwig has brought you into the fold, acknowledging your role as audience but also as witness.This is most apparent in the scenes of the movie that other reviewers have deemed feminist. The whole point of Barbie (the movie and the doll's origins) are to make women feel seen, feel valued and to show that you can be you without collecting things to validate your identity.I absolutely loved every minute of this film and I am so happy that it was made. Thank you to everyone involved in this project, you truly created movie magic.I am unsurprised that there are negative reviews for this movie, as some people do not enjoy looking at the truth head on. Suspend any need for Complacent Barbie, and embrace the wonderful magic of this movie.(barely a spoiler) the second to the last scene of Barbie made me feel the way I did when watching Lovecraft Country, episode 7 (titled ""I am."") if you need a dose of that energy before you can see the movie again, I absolutely recommend it.

There is an interest in philosophy and morality, but no understanding of the actions and consequences. All the time there is too much political witch hunt and game in the US and too few mentions and scenes of the effects of radiation, humanitarian crisis and suffering in Japan.The film could have used many more pictures of the victims and a reminder that nuclear power should never have been used in history and should not be used in warfare in the future, not in this decade and not in the decades to come.An apology is completely absent at state level.",Oppenheimer

10.0,The best movie in years!,vsteinman,22 July 2023,This movie is a master piece through and through. Not one part of it was bad. This movie single handedly is the best one that's come out in years since covid slammed the movie industry into the dirt. There's been disappointment after disappointment in the years since its ended. This movie is not that though. The entire story is told in full detail without leaving out any of it in a perfectly easy way to follow. The sound track was also amazing in this. This entire movie will single handedly be the best some of these actors and the director ever took part in. It's also my strong opinion that anyone that says it was bad is a dumb as idiot that probably has no interest in history.,Oppenheimer

7.0,Oppenheimer,CinemaSerf,26 July 2023,"Cillian Murphy offers an assured and considered performance here as the man who is credited with developing the bomb that hastened the end of WWII in the far east. He is the increasingly acclaimed, eponymous, physicist who is made aware by Admiral Lewis Strauss (another strong performance from Robert Downey Jr.) that it just possible that the Russians have the A-bomb. Now Oppenheimer already suspects that the Nazis are also well on their way to weaponising the atom - his earlier education and career had introduced him to some of the prominent minds in the UK and in Germany who were quite capable of taking the theory forward; so he begins to pressurise the American government to begin it's own programme - and the ""Manhattan Project"" is born. Motivated/goaded/galvanised by the ambitious ""Col. Groves"" (Matt Damon) he assembles a formidable collection of scientific minds at a purpose built, desert, location which he christens Los Alamos, and over the next three years - and with $2bn to spend - they work on the science whilst plutonium and uranium are being simultaneously processed at an irkingly glacial pace! Given that much of this is reasonably well documented history, the actual plot here has little by way of jeopardy. Instead, Christopher Nolan attempts via his writing and direction to put some meat on the bones of the characters here. It's clear that Oppenheimer is a bit of a Lothario, but it's also clear that he can engender the loyalty of a variety of people with diverging views - not just surrounding the science of their project, but around the morals and ethics of creating something that - well, you can't get the toothpaste back into the tube. The latter portion of this drama focusses on the subsequent, communist-obsessed, witch-hunting that went on attempting to persecute and smear this remarkable and flawed individual, and it makes some interesting postulations about just who was pulling whose strings. It also has quite a penetrating resonation about it - not just, specifically, about Oppeneheimer - but about all of those post-event ""enquiries"" that rarely deliver an honest appraisal of what was done in the name of expediency at the time, but ends up more of a character assassination exercise by those who didn't do anything against those who did and had to. Though at times the pace of this thing helps to keep it enthralling, it is too long - at times it really does plod along. Perhaps an other, objective, eye on the writing/direction may have tightened it up without having to sacrifice any of the potency of the story. Maybe someone needs to tell Mr. Nolan that a three hour film isn't always required! That said, it's a gorgeous film to look at. The aesthetics are first rate and the entire sentiment of the film reeks of authenticity. I do think this thrives better on a big screen so try to see it as it was intended. It's though provoking, complex, characterful - and well worth a watch.",Oppenheimer
5.0,Too annoying to be enjoyable,keniwhat,25 July 2023,"An intriguing character, an historic time, a chance to show what made the man whose name the film bears, squandered on an overbearing visual and audio production. Loud, building, ever-present music, probably to make up for the lack of dramatic dialogue in the script. No family back-story, none of the quirks of his character as a young man, just a series of short episodes in labs while music plays incessantly and too loudly. Jumping back and forth in time, to create a sense of mystery to demonstrate a great man taken down by pettiness. You can't make this movie without hitting some high notes and the test scene brilliant, and the sense of moral regret is well delivered. But the overall production, especially the editing, and the focus on the 'trial' and the decision to omit the early back-story years, creates a gap that is never quite filled, despite the brilliance of Cillian Murphy portraying a man struggling with the impact of what he has unleashed on the world, not to mention a host of fabulous cameos.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Exceptional film about the father of the atomic bomb!,roxy3499,28 July 2023,"This movie was absolutely brilliant. The performance from Cillian Murphy was so genuine as J. Robert Oppenheimer. A perfect performance from him.Robert Downey Jr also had one of the top performances in the film as well. One of the greatest of his career. Give that man an Oscar! Matt Damon, Josh Harnett, Florence Pugh and Emily blur also gave incredible performances too. The guy that played Albert Einstein looked exactly like the genius himself I was spooked but in a good way.The sound in this film was a little scary. It physically made me jump, it was sonical.Christopher Nolan's direction on this phenomenal masterpiece was Masterclass and is for me the one to win best director throughout awards season.This movie for me is everything not one bad thing to say. Perfectly written, directed, cast and the production design was on a whole other level. Bless this film one of the greatest films of all time. 10/10.",Oppenheimer
5.0,cute but boring,pzcxfbnh,26 July 2023,"Whenever someone says they disliked the movie most people tell them it's because they are not getting the plot correctly or they simply don't get feminism. I am a girl and a feminist and this movie was all marketing, ik i'm not saying something new. It was a cute story but half of the dialogues were bad/kinda cringy. Also, many relationships were presented to us, for example the mom and her daughter, and the movie never bothered to show us a little backstory, it had potential. At least I really appreciated that the main purpose of the movie was to show women everyday struggles, loved the monologue.I think it's a nice movie, but not worth the hype like to watch it in the cinema.",Barbie
10.0,Historically Dense and Very Rewarding,tompmcr,24 July 2023,"A very well executed historical piece. It seems like every part worked: the writing, pacing, soundtrack, acting, visuals, everything. It's a very dense 3 hour movie that stays true to the history and source material. While you can probably enjoy the movie without knowing much history of the subject, it's very rewarding if you learn some background on the Manhattan Project, Los Alamos, Oppenheimer, and Strauss as there isn't much handholding done by Nolan.The tension building was excellent and the pacing was great, considering it made an hour of government bueracracy actually engaging.The practical effects used worked well to give us insight into Oppenheimer's brewing internal conflict and sense of regret. And all the actors present their roles well, seeing as all of those people were complex historical characters.Lastly Matt Damon brings his own charm to his portrayal of Groves and does not disappoint.This is definitely one of the best movies I've seen and is a must watch for scientists, engineers, and world war 2 history enthusiasts.",Oppenheimer
1.0,Politics ruining an already weak plot,amirparsanazemi,19 July 2023,"Could have genuinely been a fun and cheerful movie except the feminist speeches and the cliche attempts at forcing political ideologies in a movie with a young target audience. Also, every man in it is portrayed either as a bigot or a loser, truly disgusting. I dont see how teaching young girls that the world is pitched against them, encouraging them to lure men and put them against each other in order to take away their powers and generally showing men as dumb and gullible is going to help us in the society, except to polarize us even further as we decay and watch our societies crumble. Truly disappointed.",Barbie
4.0,"Colorful and educational, but weak plot renders it unexciting",newgraexx,27 July 2023,"I think a film has value if it entertains and/or educates.Barbie entertains with its bright and colorful sets,and its very humorous tongue-in-cheek jibes at patriachy and consumerism.It educates by colorfully and humorously depicting the dangers and folly of stereotyping and consumerist attitudes.To me, the above gives the film only mediocre value to the viewer because they are not accompanied by a strong plot.In other words, society is filled with many and various alternative films with exciting plots and the educational messaging, so why would a viewer bother with this plot-deficient film?Yes, Iknow the film's box office is huge (viewers did bother to see it), which prompts me to think that its reported $150m marketing spend was very effective. Thats what I call consumerism++.Special mention to Ryan Gosling - he's a natural in this film; he played the part very well.",Barbie

1.0,not good,jamustafa-20301,26 July 2023,"Title: ""Barbie the Movie (2023): A Disastrous Attempt at Childhood Nostalgia""As a moviegoer who grew up in the '90s, I was excited to hear about the release of ""Barbie the Movie"" in 2023, hoping to relive some of the cherished memories from my childhood. However, my anticipation quickly turned into disappointment as I witnessed the abysmal spectacle that unfolded on the big screen. It is with great regret that I have to say that ""Barbie the Movie"" fails on almost every level, leaving audiences with an insipid and soulless film that tarnishes the legacy of the beloved doll.First and foremost, the plot is nothing short of a train wreck. The filmmakers seem to have thrown together a hodgepodge of ideas from various Barbie storylines without any coherence or logical progression. The story lacks depth and originality, resembling a half-baked amalgamation of clichés and poorly executed tropes. Characters are introduced haphazardly and underdeveloped, making it impossible to invest emotionally in their journey. The movie's attempt at incorporating a meaningful life lesson for young viewers is superficial and forced, further adding to the sense of disconnected storytelling.Despite advancements in animation technology, the visual aspects of ""Barbie the Movie"" are utterly lackluster. The character designs, while attempting to modernize Barbie's appearance, end up feeling awkward and lifeless. The vibrant world of Barbie, which has always been a highlight of the doll's appeal, is rendered in a way that lacks imagination and fails to capture the enchanting charm that Barbie's universe should exude. It's evident that the filmmakers prioritized commercial viability over artistic integrity, leading to a generic and forgettable visual experience.The voice acting in the film is another major letdown. Instead of enlisting talented and experienced voice actors, the studio seems to have opted for A-list celebrities who lend their voices to the iconic characters. However, the performances lack sincerity and authenticity, with the actors sounding disinterested and disengaged throughout the movie. This casting choice backfires, as the celebrity voices overshadow the essence of the characters they portray, making it challenging to connect with them on any level.Moreover, ""Barbie the Movie"" shamelessly indulges in product placements and corporate tie-ins. Rather than focusing on crafting a compelling narrative, the film becomes an unabashed marketing tool, attempting to push Barbie merchandise onto the audience. Such blatant commercialization not only detracts from the viewing experience but also feels exploitative of the nostalgic feelings that many viewers may have for the iconic doll.The film's attempts at humor also fall flat, relying on tired and predictable jokes that fail to elicit even a chuckle. The lack of wit or cleverness in the script makes the movie feel like a slog, and one can't help but wonder if the writers put any effort into crafting genuinely amusing dialogue.As if all these issues weren't enough, ""Barbie the Movie"" also suffers from pacing problems. Scenes drag on for what seems like an eternity, while others are rushed without proper development. The result is an uneven and disjointed film that fails to maintain any semblance of engagement, leaving the audience bored and disinterested.In conclusion, ""Barbie the Movie"" (2023) is an unmitigated disaster that squanders the potential of a beloved childhood icon. The film's lackluster plot, underwhelming animation, subpar voice acting, shameless commercialization, and uninspired humor culminate in a movie that is an insult to the timeless character of Barbie. As a nostalgic trip down memory lane, this film misses the mark by a long shot, leaving both children and adults alike yearning for the magic that the Barbie brand once held. Save your time and money, and avoid this regrettable cinematic misadventure.",Barbie
6.0,"Barbie... Better than I thought, but fell a little short",cinemaconnoisseur-52823,22 July 2023,"Scoreboard:Overall Score: 6.7/10Storyline/Plot: 6.8/10Acting: 8/10Directing: 7/10Ending: 7/10Cinematography: 6.5/10Comedy: 6.8/10Action: 5.9/10Overall Review:Firstly, in all my years of being a Cinema Connoisseur, it is rare to see a movie sell out as quickly and widespread as Barbie. So well done to the Barbie marketing team!I walked in the cinema with no expectations, but I have to say I was overall pleasantly surprised with Barbie. I thought it might be the usual run of the mill silly kids movie, with a completely unserious/unrealistic storyline.However, the Barbie storyline touched on a lot of serious real world issues and situations that many people can relate to. With that said, it did feel like a senseless musical at times, with unesscessary sing/dance scenes.The essence of the film touches on the juxtaposition of what life would be like if women ruled the world (Barbie Land). And the real world we live in, which is male dominated. This was portrayed well, but did get abit too silly sometimes.The level of acting from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, were both bang on. Considering they were playing dolls, they kept a great balance between having to act silly, whilst still keeping a level of seriousness, so the sillyness doesn't go overboard.Overall, ""Barbie"" was actually a decent watch with a good level of comedy and realism, whilst keeping the essence of what Barbie represents.Isit worth a watch?... Whether you are a woman or man, young or old. Barbie has a little bit for everyone to relate to. So for that reason it is worth a watch, but don't go in with high hopes unless you are a die hard Barbie fan!",Barbie
10.0,This movie changed my entire life,antoninawiecek,22 July 2023,"I swear to god this movie is one of the best i've seen this year. My expectations were high BUT NOT THAT HIGH. I'm not sure if this movie is good for small kids, they may not understand the problems this film addresses. I'm really happy that this movie was created because we should talk more about this problem (I don't wanna say what is this problem coz it would be a spoiler and i want you guys to have a surprise). And seeing Ryan Gosling in this role is something i would never expect to see. We know Ryan from all those mysterious and dark action films so seeing him dancing in colorful clothes and doing all these crazy stuff is incredible. I love this man and I love him even more now, i'm so grateful that he took part in such a great project that addresses such a huge problems. If you're still wondering if you should go or not the answer is YOU DEFINITELY HAVE TO GO.",Barbie
6.0,Strong Start... and That's It,lokicola,24 July 2023,"I walked out of the theatre thinking, ""Yeah, I had a good time in that movie"". But as the day went on I kind had that ""Ok, that kebab probably wasn't a good idea.""The film is stunning in its production design and creativity, and Margot Robbie is perfectly cast as the Stereotypical Barbie. For the most part, the songs are catchy and performances are solid for the type of characters being portraying.When we strip away the outside world and all the messaging, Barbie and Ken have a few poignant moments - Barbie realising she's not as perfect as she's been made to believe, or when Ken receives his first modicum of acknowledgement of being a sentient being he's ever had in his life. They also share a couple learning and growth moments which I thought would pay off at the end of the film.I don't know why, but I was hoping for something that would actually enlighten its audience, to acknowledge that things are a mess and make intentional and meaningful steps to get us closer to understanding and equality. The Barbie brand, history, controversies are so engrained in our culture that this movie had a potential to change our perspective of the world, and what the future could be. That's a lot of pressure for one film, I know.However... this film is absolutely not immune to the not-so-subtle messaging that has permeated all forms of media and entertainment recently. In fact, it embraces is. So much so that you have a scene where a man walks up behind Barbie and slaps her on the backside, in broad daylight, in a crowded space, in front of her boyfriend.... And this kind of portrayal of men in 2023 appears to be how the film views the world.Maybe it was this kind of overt comical depiction of men and the world generally that allowed me to get through the movie and kind of enjoy it, but upon reflection, I realise now it's just kind of... yuck.Barbie had the rare opportunity to be a film experience that not only highlighted issues in the real world, but offer and foster some ideas for change. Instead, we receive divisive and mean-spirited attack on half the human population as well as anyone who thinking having a family is an acceptable path in life. And also flat feet and cellulite.If you kind of switch off your brain for an hour and a bit, and don't take this film too seriously, then maybe you'll have a lasting positive memory after seeing this movie.But if you need to do that to enjoy something, then you need to ask yourself: why?",Barbie
9.0,"before trinity, after trinity.",alibrahim1,22 July 2023,"A lot of mixed emotions about this movie. But what a incredible performance by Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey, Chris Nolan.Enjoyed every part of it. Amazing cinematography, directing and acting.Things I Disliked:Before the Trinity test, Chris Nolan combined about 4 timelines at the same time at a very fast pace. Very complicated, Very confusing and if I didn't have a background on Oppenheimer's case and history I wouldn't have have an idea where this movie is going.Very very complicated storyline chronology. Within minutes you find yourself in different settings/topics and you have to put in the pieces together.Fast dialogue, storyline switching fast, multiple topics at the same time. Even some scenes weren't that important and would not hurt the movie if the narrative was made in order (from beginning of his study to the trial).What was I expecting of Chris Nolan right?But that's just before the trinity test where things got interesting for me.It would have been better if we understood some characters better like Emily Blunts (Kitty Oppenheimer) and Robert Downey Jr. (Lewis Strauss) character's who i find interesting but weren't emphasized and underlined.Things I liked:What a sensational performance by Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. Those two are remembered and famous for one role, but in this movie you never thought of them as Thomas Shelby or Ironman. Even the change in sentiment about Strauss after the second part was great. Emily blunt was great regardless of the fact the I think her character wasn't emphasized that much. I felt like her amazing performance at her scene at the end of movie made it like we know everything about her and her personality relating to her husband.This was one of my best experiences in cinema regarding visual and sound effects. Can't limit this to a certain scene. Enjoyed every second of it. Didn't even feel the 3 hours.Bravo Chris Nolan.",Oppenheimer

This is a movie to celebrate how diverse and complicated are the humans. The cinematography is a outstanding as well as the production design and the vestuary. The casting seems like made in heaven. I recommend this movie for 11+ years old. And if you have a teen at home, take her with you. Barbie goes from fun to introspection and I love a good comedy that makes you think. Ryan Gosling is the perfect Ken, he does everything in this movie and shines every time he shows up. Margo is a perfect Barbie and got a real sense of the relevance this is going to have.",Barbie
10.0,CINEMATIC MASTERPIECE,abualissamtayma,21 July 2023,"Latest masterpiece from visionary director Christopher Nolan, is a filmmaking brilliance that delivers an unparalleled cinematic experience. GRIPPING historical drama brilliantly showcases Nolan's mastery of storytelling the ability to provoke thought and emotion in the audience.The film's narrative unfolds perfectly, interweaving the complex life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist behind the development of the atomic bomb. Nolan's storytelling finesse kept me on the edge of my seat, deftly exploring Oppenheimer's moral implications of his work without losing sight of grand historical events.""Oppenheimer"" is a feast for eyes, thanking the impeccable cinematography and stunning practical effects. Nolan's signature practical approach to filmmaking, eschewing CGI whenever possible, heightens the realism and authenticity of the film's World War II era setting.This movie is a thought-provoking exploration of the human psyche, ethics, and the consequences of scientific advancements. Nolan's deft handling of these themes elevates the film beyond a mere biopic, making it a poignant reflection on the choices we make as a society and as individuals.""Oppenheimer"" is a cinematic triumph that reaffirms Christopher Nolan's place as one of the greatest if not THE greatest directors of our time. With his impeccable storytelling, mesmerizing visuals, and powerful performances, it deserves nothing less than a perfect 10/10 rating.

8.0,Not for everyone,wadalkaraditya,23 July 2023,I have watched this movie with my friends. Most of them got bored all the way throughout the movie.they did not understand the science and history behind all of this. But for me this was something different than other drama war documentaries. This was thought provoking one.we got to understand the Oppenheimers point of view and what a nuclear weapon can do. If it was not then someone sure have used atleast once nuclear bomb. We got to learn the history n power politics at that time. How scientists can change the war scenarios. How spies played their role in nuclear chase. It was so much to understand and comprehend for future generations.,Oppenheimer
10.0,A wholesome delight!,Anurag-Shetty,23 July 2023,"Barbie is based on Mattel's iconic plastic dolls of the same name. Barbie(Margot Robbie) lives a very happy life in Barbie Land, along with her fellow Barbies, Ken(Ryan Gosling) & his fellow Kens. Suddenly, Barbie goes through an existential crisis that makes her question Barbie Land & the truth of her existence.Barbie is a phenomenal film. Director Greta Gerwig has given us a movie that is a tribute to everyone who used to play with Barbie dolls during their childhood, while also making fun of all the tropes of Barbie dolls & Ken dolls. This film is hilarious, with a few emotional scenes that will make you tear up & a beautiful message at the end. The production design by Sarah Greenwood is awe-inspiring. All the songs are foot-tappingly flawless. The choreography is faultless. Margot Robbie is outstanding as Barbie. Robbie's multi-layered portrayal of the titular character, proves that she's the perfect choice to play Barbie. Ryan Gosling is spectacular as Ken. Gosling portrays a wide range of emotions, effortlessly. Ryan Gosling's Ken is the highlight of the movie. America Ferrera is fantastic as Gloria. Ariana Greenblatt is awesome as Sasha. Will Ferrell is hysterical as the Mattel CEO. Michael Cera is perfect as Allan. Helen Mirren is epic as the Narrator. The supporting cast is superb. Barbie is a must watch for a burst of childhood nostalgia & fans of Greta Gerwig, Margot Robbie & Ryan Gosling.

It fit the atmosphere of this film perfectly. The acting is incredible. The story telling is perfectly put together. For 3 hours of dialogue I was engaged frame to frame from this film.

7.0,I want to like it....,mikinsahedani,25 July 2023,"Firstly, fantastic acting by Cillian and Downey. Amazing cameo by Gary Oldman. Rest of the cast were good nothing extraordinary. But my personal problem was the story makes a lot of jump cuts which is fine, but before going in the movie audience is expected to do a little bit of homework. Two hearings were going on in the beginning and only much later we are explained what's going on, but by that time I got exhausted just keeping up. Also once the explanation is given I didn't care enough. I usually don't check time or speak with anyone during the movie but it was very hard not to. I liked Downey's acting better than Cillian btw.",Oppenheimer
3.0,Who is this movie for?,kjreiter,23 July 2023,"When we saw the trailer for this movie I knew that my wife was going to want to see it. I really wanted this to be a fun movie and figured it would poke fun at itself a bit. Ryan Gossling and Morton Robbie did a great job as actors. But they were not given a cohesive script and story line. This movie was all over the place. It was not fun and it never is when you are watching overlong dialog, songs, and dance routines. I'm not sure I can even explain the main storyline of this movie. Is that Barbie wants to be real? Does she want to help the girl, now woman that used to play with her fix the relationship with her daughter. Was it about Ken not wanting to exist as an accessory? Overall, this was not fun, funny and ended up being tedious and actually boring. This is not a movie for little girls and it is not a movie for adults either. This is a really big missed opportunity.",Barbie
6.0,Spectacular And Amazing But Not Entertaining,triloknaresh4,23 July 2023,"I'm an admirer of Nolan's movies. He casts or selects someone for his movie with utmost care, which he has done the same for this movie as well. Particularly C. Murphy, he is the best choice to play Oppenheimer's character. He lived in the character and has given his best. R. Downey & M. Damon were great supporting actors too. Nolan's display of Oppenheimer's life was spectacular and at times were outstanding. The bombing scenes or the trauma scenes or the flashback scenes, they were outstanding for sure.Coming to the negatives, the movie is not at all gripping. Most of his movies gives edge of the seat kind of experience namely Inception, Dark Knight series etc., but this one actually is not at all entertaining in fact it made me boring at times. I felt it like a documentary. I feel, Nolan's standards have gone down.Sorry this is in my opinion, but others might like the movie a lot or intact they might call it entertaining.",Oppenheimer

It is easy to be done, but jumpin back and forth on the timeline, learning many-many new characters every other 5 minutes just takes away from the experience of watching a movie.Personally I miss any technical details and science.

10.0,"a love letter to women, girlhood and growing up outside of a world run by the patriarchy",atomeckova,23 July 2023,"To me, Barbie was a wonderful exploration of feminity and womanhood while also encompassing themes of patriarchy and the entitlement of men. I wasn't really sure what to expect beforehand but i was truly enjoying it and smiling nearly the whole time. It pains me, how all women and girls will be able to relate to some of the scenes and it angers me so much how men seeing this movie just hate it for the sake of hating something pink and fun.Men aside, i do think it healed something in me, however cliché it sounds and i will gladly rewatch it (would definitely show it to my future daughter, if i planned to have one). I think it's an incredible celebration of femininity and i think women deserve to enjoy every second of it without having to worry about anything or anyone else <3.",Barbie
10.0,A Masterpiece of Cinematic Brilliance - Oppenheimer (2023),gustavorossiribeiro,22 July 2023,"Oppenheimer is a cinematic triumph that left me utterly spellbound from start to finish. Watching it in glorious 70mm was an experience like no other, immersing me into the stunning visuals that perfectly captured the essence of each scene. The use of color was masterful, enhancing the storytelling and evoking a range of emotions throughout the film.The editing was seamless, seamlessly transitioning between timelines and characters, making it easy to follow the complex narrative. The film's pacing kept me engaged throughout, and I found myself completely absorbed in the characters' lives and struggles.One aspect that stood out significantly was the impeccable sound design. The audio intricacies elevated the entire movie-watching experience, adding depth and authenticity to the story's various layers. It enhanced the emotions and intensity, leaving a lasting impact on my senses.Oppenheimer's storytelling was nothing short of breathtaking. The way it explored the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, and delved into his complex personality, motivations, and the ethical dilemmas he faced, was a captivating journey.Every actor's performance was stellar, bringing life to their respective characters, making them relatable and human. The attention to detail and the commitment to historical accuracy were commendable, making Oppenheimer not just an entertaining film, but also an educational one.In conclusion, Oppenheimer is an extraordinary masterpiece that stands as a testament to the power of cinema. It weaves together history, art, and emotion into a symphony that stays with you long after the credits roll. Christopher Nolan has truly crafted a work of art, and I can confidently say that it is the best movie I have ever watched. If you appreciate remarkable storytelling, top-notch cinematography, and impeccable sound design, do not miss the opportunity to experience Oppenheimer.",Oppenheimer

10.0,Laughing from beginning to end,juliadillon-13606,24 July 2023,"I went to this movie without watching previews or expecting anything. This movie turned out to be everything a Barbie-loving thirty-something needed twenty years ago. Expertly cast, the Barbie movie is hilariously self-aware and has no dull moments. Though the Micheal is obviously mainly about Barbie, Ken has his own moment to shine that ends up being the subplot.The movie was beautiful visually and funny from beginning to end. The attention to detail was clear and the storyline had the theater crying happy tears by the end. Definitely see it if you are a parent and take your parent friends with you. Make sure you wear pink ;)We would see it again and again!",Barbie
8.0,Brilliant dialogues. Keeps Engaged most of the times!,coolhunk55,24 July 2023,"Don't watch this movie if you want to see how the first Atom bomb was made or the WWII ended.Watch it if you love brilliant dialogues. The dialogues are master piece and so is the switch from current time frame to the past and back.The characters have played their roles brilliantly. Murphy and Robert have done justice to their characters, so has Matt.The movie is long, 180 plus minutes and that is where it captures the details and the essence of the court room drama. Doesn't stay in one time frame for so long that you get bored and swaps to past frame to make it relevant and a bit confusing at the same time (don't get me wrong with confusing word as it might get tricky if you don't follow the dialogues).This is not Interstellar, so don't go expecting to see space crafts and bombs and fights. The fight is in the courtroom for everyone to see.",Oppenheimer
10.0,A masterpiece by Chris Nolan,leonardodallaporta,22 July 2023,"Oppenheimer has everything to be the film of the year. One of the few films recorded in Imax, surreal, certainly adds to the experience.About the film, it is the consecration of Chris Nolan's directing style. The execution of the work with his signature this time was perfect, no narrative slips, nothing exaggerated and nothing omitted, the film uses the techniques in the right measure.The filmmaker's best film so far brings back the puzzle narrative, in a more spiral format, especially at the beginning of the film. This type of narrative is one that makes you think, build the film along with the execution of it. The beginning of the film demands a lot of attention. Many timelines in quick scene cuts, many new persons introduced, many situations presented out of order: it is the perfect experience for those who enjoy this type of film. Like a puzzle, you're given several pieces that are unlocked for you to piece together the story. If you lose your attention in those first 30-45 minutes of plot and can't put together the narrative, it will be difficult to understand from there. When the pieces fall into place and you understand the timelines (which are few here, when it comes to Nolan), enjoying the art of the film in the next 2:30 hours of film is a great experience!Oppenheimer brings a new way to watch a biopic unlike anything you've watched before in this genre. The three hours of film pass as if they were one, the pace of the film is electrifying, quick cuts, quick takes, most scenes last a few seconds, before moving on to another point in the story. Very few scenes drag on for more than 30 seconds.The casting is immense, there are many characters, many actors, many names (which may sound confusing at some point), that the film does not prioritize presenting the trajectory of each one in detail - and it would never have been able to, such a large number of actors -, the performances are of a high level, and the puzzle narrative diminishes in the middle of the film, helping to understand the narrative thread in this large number of actors. Cillian Murphy's performance is extraordinary, by far the best developed character in all of Nolan's filmography, it gave him space to shine and he delivers a lot. Robert Downey Jr also delivers a great performance, in fact the best or one of the best of his career. Emily Blunt manages to dominate the dramatic scenes throughout the film. In my opinion, a cohesive script, with the perfect screen time for each character, given the relevance of each one in the story.Cinematography, visual effects (no cgi), editing, original score and sound editing are categories with a high probability of awards. The original score and editing of this film, in particular, caught my attention too much, quick cuts, great editing, non-linear at times, and when linear, with short scenes, in addition to the original score that holds you in your chair and gives a frantic pace to the film are exceptional.In summary, this film has Nolan at his best (debuting in a new studio, Universal), in his best film, managing to overcome all the negative nuances that hovered over his other works (little tenacity with the characters and exaggeration in his non-linear narrative vices). Far surpassing his last work, Tenet, which is his worst film.Oppenheimer is finished, mature, and Nolan's best yet. It has a chance in virtually all award categorias o Oscars. 10/10.",Oppenheimer
3.0,Days of Fun Movies are over,omerus91,21 July 2023,"Walked out during intermission.Visually, a fantastic job. Big props to the art and costume crew. Barbie Land was incredibly well made. The colors and the lighting in the film were on point.Not a bad idea for the plot, but the movie itself didn't care about the plot.Execution... You may as well get a hot pink piece of paper and a bright yellow pen, write ""Men are bad. Patriarchy is bad. Women are good. Unless they're really attractive, in which case they're also bad."" and read it aloud over and over and over again for 2 hours.The trailer made it seem like this would be a sort of movie that hasn't really been made since the mid-2000s which is a fun (""fun"" being the keyword) adventure with silly/supernatural elements to it. Sillly is me for thinking that that could happen in 2023...",Barbie
9.0,Just like all other Nolan movies its the best IMAX experience,subxerogravity,22 July 2023,"Give it up to Christopher Nolan he knows how to make an Imax picture and he's dictated to this format like no other. Other filmmakers who say they make movies in IMAX are cheating you just a little. Like the last good IMAX movie, Mission: Impossible Dark Reckoning. Christopher McQuarrie knows all the good action scenes to put into IMAX to cheat you out of the entire flick being IMAX but Nolan is not about that and that makes for a beautiful motion picture.But I have to admit, going into this I was thinking Oppenheimer would be like Independence Day in the sense that I came to see something blow up and once that happen, I was done. This movie is soo long and it kept going. I forgot that this movie was about the man that created the bomb not the bomb itselfOverall, Nolan's tells the story of John Oppenheimer and he tells a great story and made a visually stunning movie out of it. One of his best.",Oppenheimer
10.0,An experience like no other!,sandro-salemme2,26 July 2023,"Oppenheimer is probably up there with one of the best films I've seen... in a very long time. The feeling you have through the whole 3 hours is gargantuan - it leaves you feeling sad and scared throughout. The quick edited scenes, the feeling of dread in every scene, with the use of intense music and sound. It was most definitely did not feel like a 3 hour movie. The pacing is just right, the blend of the storyline, from start to finish is like a loud and finely tuned machine. Probably my favourite Nolan film to date. I'm sure others will think Nolan has done better, but it's probably my personal favourite. I 100% intend going to see it again at the cinema - if you are planning on watching this, find time to watch it at the cinema, and if you can, an IMAX, this film is an experience.",Oppenheimer
10.0,The best film which I ever seen,lusofia,27 July 2023,"My favorite movie has always been ""Interstellar."" No other film could evoke such emotions in me as it does. Christopher Nolan's new film once again managed to bring back those feelings and sensations while watching it. When you watch ""Oppenheimer,"" you experience the entire range of emotions and sensations that a film can offer. Throughout all three hours, you'll be thrilled by the brilliance of the film, screenplay, music, visual effects, acting, directing, and cinematography. Everything is meticulously thought out and meaningful, making it exceptionally perfect and captivating. You completely immerse yourself in the film and become a part of it, living the lives of the characters, sharing their emotions. After viewing, there's a sense of fulfillment and a pleasant aftertaste. Christopher Nolan's films prompt contemplation and reflection, as they should after watching a movie. I recommend them to anyone who appreciates quality cinema, values art, and simply wants to delve into the world of great films.",Oppenheimer

6.0,"Barbie is catchy, fun, important and... that's it.",eduardomelorocha-34963,23 July 2023,"Greta Gerwig, took the most famous doll of humanity, a luxury cast and made a good film with an important message!Barbie offers almost 120 minutes of fun, captivating and fluid moments. Mixing real elements with ""drawn"" scenarios, it manages to bring the two worlds together in a balanced and intelligent way, varying between ""cartoons"" and the real world.It also shows in a very intelligent way all the difficulties that women go through in their lives, such as the lack of respect for their intellectual and physical property, as well as illustrating a series of moments that illustrate patriarchy and the disrespectful way in which many men treat women and think they are superior based on their gender. A message that Ryan Gosling had in a great performance to emphasize the perspective that unfortunately still reigns in many men today.Speaking of the cast, Ryan Gosling had a script that favored him, with several scenes and different roles that allowed him to show all his versatility as an actor, and the reality is that he delivered a high-level performance, the best in the film imo, and that he managed not only to give strength to the message that he wanted to convey, but also to elevate the film to another level with his musical performances. On the other hand, imo, Margot had a script that didn't exploit all of his acting skills. Don't get me wrong, her acting is very good, within what was provided, the performance is very good, however I think the script could have given her more, due to the versatility she has!And my first negative point is precisely that. The script was too attached to the message it wanted to convey and did not use all the potential that ""Barbie"" provided, such as the affective side and its overall positive impact on many women. Furthermore, the focus on the concept limited the development of characters and a cast that had more to offer!The dialogues also suffer from a lot of fluctuations, the good dialogues are really good but seem very disconnected from the rest, as the construction even them felt lazy. It's as if they didn't connect to what just happened in the last few minutes and just came out of nowhere. It's a shame, because there are really good speeches!Finally, the message got across clearly and the most important thing is clearly retained. This movie was never about pink or a doll. It was about women and the rights they are due! Respect, freedom, and justice in relation to the opportunities they should have. Doors should open according to the work carried out and the skills demonstrated, never to the gender or color of a person! Love is love no matters what. Respect is to everyone, there's no ""but""! However, I think Greta missed an incredible opportunity to make a stronger ""statement"" about equal rights, duties and opportunities for all!In short, it's a good film, light, funny and entertaining, and can be watched several times as something to ""pass the time and have fun"" but should be watched, at least once, in a serious and dedicated way for all the message it has!",Barbie
7.0,Quality but exhausting,Bonobo13579,21 July 2023,"I'm a big fan of Nolan's work so was really looking forward to this. I understood there would be some flipping in timelines and I'd need to concentrate. I didn't find this to be a problem at all and the storytelling was beautifully done. The acting was universally excellent. I saw a review saying Emily Blunt was rather OTT but I didn't find that at all.I think my biggest gripe with the film may mean that I'm just getting old. I found the direction quite jarring with jump cuts galore. While it did keep things moving along apace, it was all rather exhausting. I also found the music and sound very very loud to the point of intrusion. Much like other Nolan films as it goes: Interstellar that I love, also had *very* loud music.All in all this is a quality watch. It just left me longing for the days when so called 'cerebral' biopics, were a little more tranquil.",Oppenheimer
6.0,"Strong middle, first and third acts are a bore",matt-27634,22 July 2023,"Oppenheimer tells the story of Robert Oppenheimer (played by Cillian Murphy), creator of the Atomic bomb and the role he played in WWII. Whilst I wasn't familiar with his backstory, I had to jump on the bandwagon and see what all the fuss was about.Cast wise, it was packed! However maybe too star-studded to the point where I found myself questioning why certain big-name actors were involved in the film given how little screen time they had. Florence Pugh's character was unnecessary, and whilst she may have meant a lot to Oppenheimer, they could have just referenced her instead. Whilst I personally found Cillian Murphy to be emotionless and monotone, I'm not familiar enough with the real life Oppenheimer to know if that was accurate or not.Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr. Have strong performances, and Josh Hartnett deserves a special mention for not aging a day since 1998.It's a long film, and there was a lot of dialogue. During some scenes, I felt like I was in a science lecture and had to try not to doze off, and as for the timeline, it was a bit confusing with black-and-white scenes and coloured ones representing various times that didn't make sense.There's no doubting that this film is great, however I just don't think I'm the type of person who would appreciate it in its finest.",Oppenheimer
4.0,"Funny and sharp first half, boring and baffling second one",Dello_,25 July 2023,"I had great expectations for the Barbie movie, mainly because of the writers (Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach) and the stellar cast with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the way. Unfortunately I found myself disappointed, bored and shocked by some messages the movie tries to convey.Starting with what I liked, the performances were great and in particular Ryan Gosling was spectacular with a wide range of emotions and a lot of humor displayed. Also the design of the sets was inspired with a lot of references to the Barbie world and the style was unique and recognisable. Finally some jokes landed pretty well and the movie (in the first half) is pretty funny. And the positives end here.Unfortunately the negatives are much more important. Sorted in a order of increasing gravity: * some plot lines are bad and are closed so quickly that it would have been better not to include them in the first place. In particular I am referring to the mother/daughter one and the one about Mattel. Furthermore, the Mattel one is also a bit strange since it is useful to criticise however uses feminism to make money, while being a movie that does exactly that.* the film becomes boring in the second half. This is due to a systematic shift in tone and style since if in the first part the satire is sharp and elegant and leads to numerous bittersweet laughs, in the second half instead the movie becomes full of exposition. There are a lot of scenes where things are directly explained to the viewer (clearly considered a bit stupid) and there are some too long monologues that are both cringe and painfully written. This is a pity because some ideas explored in the second half are interesting, but due to this shift ""Barbie"" becomes so boring to enjoy them.* the messages: I found some messages the movie is trying to convey pretty baffling. First of all the film is not about parity, but rather about gender fight and I don't think this is the correct idea to give to younger viewers. I want that children/young adults get that as a society we want equal rights and opportunities, not to fight to be the dominant genere. This is also true because of the fact that there's no a single positive male figure throughout the movie because they are all treated like enemies or like total idiots. On the other side the Barbies are perfect entities. In a certain way it seemed ""Birds of Prey"" where the situation was exactly the same but in that case there weren't two of the biggest writer in Hollywood behind. Not to mention the totally worst thing that is how the Barbie solve the main conflict: instead of using intelligence they use seduction. This is so wrong because in a movie that wants to be empowering, women are depicted as better suited in seducing instead of thinking. All of these ruin other good ideas like for instance the inversion of the point of view that is useful to explain to men what women in our society has to live every day. That was pretty interesting but it gets lost between what mentioned before.In conclusion, I was very disappointed by the ""Barbie"" movie because I actually had high hopes knowing that it could have been a fun movie with positive messages, but it was the total opposite. I've seen it with both females and males and the reactions were generally mixed and no gender pattern was evidenced in terms of appreciating it or not. However the great merit that I have to give credit to the movie is that it triggers a discussion capable of actually enrich people through sharing of experiences. And so, even if I didn't like it I'd suggest you to watch ""Barbie"" and discuss of it with your families and friends!",Barbie
5.0,Not Up to the Mark,rathorecba,25 July 2023,"One thing I don't like about this movie, there is a scene in this movie when oppenheimer was doing sex with his gf and using Hindu scripture Geeta phrase. If Christopher Nolan known for reality instead of VFX why doesn't he used real video reference and create separate scene for that movie. Before releasing, there was a hype about this movie because of Oppenheimer use the Geeta phrase after dropping the bomb by US army that was a reason, I was curious about to watch this movie but if you are not aware about physics & history, my suggestion for you do some RND first then you can watch this movie otherwise you will going to sleep on the chair. I think director doesn't explain movie so well.",Oppenheimer
9.0,"Great, epic and unique biopic but not for everyone",851222,21 July 2023,"Greetings from Lithuania.If one thing i could be grateful to ""Oppenheimer"" (2023) is that it reminded me of ""Amadeus"" (1984). The rivalry between Salieri & Mozart, or to be more precise, Salieri's hate towards Mozart and the fact that he wasn't the genius motivated his revenge and hate, and that is presisely what happens in ""Oppenheimer"" - and i will leave it at that.On the other hand, Christopher Nolans new magnum opus ""Oppenheimer"" was master class movie on its own. While the story itself is a true one, unfortunately it did not captured my attention very much because I'm living on the other part of the world and some events that happens in third act of the film didn't really left me interested in them. What did kept me involved was brilliant filmmaking by Mr. Nolan. ""Oppenheimer"" is a real cinema for movie lovers - not especially a Friday night movie theater crowd - this was not a crowd-pleaser by any means. With cast as amazing as in here, i was been glued to me screen because of amazing performers, amazing directing, music, sound effects and cinematography. Script was great and more unique then i could imagine. And i have no doubts that Robert Downey Jr. Will get his Oscar nomination for this film - he stole every scene he was in - this is his take on Salieri.And Cillian Murphy was as good as he ever was.Overall, ""Oppenheimer"" felt like a unique movie theater experience, because i will probably never going to see film like this on a big screen soon again. Its ""artsy"", not a mainstream Friday night film and because of that it will leave many scratching their heads. But for those willing to take a chance, this is a biopic like no other.",Oppenheimer
9.0,A human-plastic semi-egalitarian world,ASuitableUsername,24 July 2023,"Barbie, with a surprising amount of political undertones, will probably be one of the most surprising releases of 2023.The movie showcases both sides of the coin, hyper-femininity and hyper-masculinity, with subtle jabs and character realisations throughout the entire film without becoming exhausting.It's undeniable that Barbie is a female empowerment movie but it's one that everyone can get behind.My only disappointments is that Micheal Cera got a marginal amount of screen time despite being the comedic punching bag, and it would of been nice to spend a little more time in Barbieland.Everyone will have their own take on this screenplay, and it might take a few viewings to understand the messages that the film is trying to provide to the viewer, but by no means is this movie bad.",Barbie
7.0,A Clinical Biopic That Lacks Soul,seanw-14429,27 July 2023,"The issue I have with Nolan films is I find them to be emotionally disengaging, I find Oppenheimer no different.There is no doubting the stunning cinematography, impressive sound design and strong performances, yet I find it difficult to connect to the characters and story, Nolan's clinical approach to storytelling leaves you feeling distant.The all too familiar non-linear narrative can at times leave the film feeling disjointed, I can't see a reason why in Biopic it is necessary, it adds little to the film in both narrative and artistically. Despite the 3-hour run it feels rushed towards the end, As the film moves its attention entirely to the post war setting, Nolan tries to cram as much as he can into the last half hour, leading to a feeling of information overload. The film tries to tell two stories. The story of the creation of the atom bomb reaches at satisfactory conclusion, however the post war maybe should've been a separate film in order to flesh the detail and give it some space to breath.Cillian Murphy is superb as always and the support cast was excellent, every scene there seemed to be recognisable face in minor role. I would have liked to have seen more of Emily Blunt, I felt she was underutilised and brought some much-needed emotional drive to the film.Overall, from a technical perspective It's a great film but it leaves me not feeling a whole lot of anything towards it, it certainly won't linger in my head and I doubt I'll be coming back for a second viewing.....7/10.",Oppenheimer
8.0,A Flamboyantly Doll-lightful Adventure,MisterJxroen,21 July 2023,"My mother was the only person I could convince to go watch Greta Gerwig's ""Barbie"" (2023) with me, and ""wow"" am I glad we went. It's been a while since I've seen such a genuinely fun and creative movie. Originality is what the world has been longing for!The story is clever and manages to be remain lightheaded and witty, while also conveying influential messages for- and challenging the audience with questions about modern feminism and discovering who you really want to be, no matter who you are.This film is colorful and 'alive', making it a joy to view upon. The set pieces, especially in Barbieland, are brilliant- and it truly makes me want to know if they actually built out a real-life Barbieland set. Did they?!The acting was brilliant from everyone; you could tell they were all having a lot of enjoyment on set. Margot Robbie carried this film for sure, as one can come to expect from this modern superstar. It was also enlightening to see Ryan Gosling take on such a comical role while also bringing a lot of depth to the character. He has a great sense of comedic timing and humor. From what I've seen in interviews, Ryan is basically embracing his comedic genius and I love it.I usually despise singing and dancing in movies, but in this film it put a smile on my face. Not just because it was amusing to watch, but because these people can actually perform really well on these fronts. It goes without saying that the music for this film was on point as well.I highly recommend everyone to go see this film, though maybe don't watch it directly before or after ""Oppenheimer"" in case you're following the current trend. Let both films sink in for a bit because they each deserve the attention.",Barbie
10.0,Genius! We need more movies like this one!,fthkgdcc,23 July 2023,"Barbie, directed by Greta Gerwig, is a satirical and surreal comedy masterpiece that subverts and celebrates the iconic doll and her world. It's a small art house film on a big blockbuster scale. It's something we need more. It deserves acclaim for that risk that Mattel, WB, Gerwig and all its Cast and Crew took. Margot Robbie stars as Barbie, a plastic perfectionist who struggles to fit in with the rigid expectations of her society. When she is expelled from Barbieland for not being flawless enough, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery in the real world, where she meets a diverse and colorful cast of characters who challenge and inspire her. Along the way, she learns to embrace her flaws, find her voice, and unleash her inner sparkle.Gerwig's direction is brilliant, balancing humor and heart with a sharp eye for detail and a playful sense of style. The film is full of witty references, clever jokes, and hilarious situations that poke fun at the absurdity and contradictions of Barbie's culture, while also honoring its legacy and appeal. The cinematography, production design, and costumes are stunning, creating a vibrant and immersive visual experience that contrasts the artificiality of Barbieland with the realism of the human world.Robbie's and Gosling's performance is outstanding, capturing both the innocence and the sass of Barbie, as well as her growth and transformation. Gosling shines so bright in this. His song is chef's kiss! They are supported by a stellar ensemble. Barbie is a film that will make you laugh, cry, and think. It is a smart and subversive commentary on gender, beauty, identity, and consumerism, as well as a tribute to the power of imagination, creativity, and individuality. It is a film that proves that anyone can be anything they want to be, as long as they are true to themselves. It is a film that deserves a 10/10 rating. The Godfather of whatever this movie's genre is....",Barbie
10.0,The best version of itself,masonsaul,21 July 2023,"Barbie is everything expected of it and so much more, a self aware and meta comedy made for fans and newcomers alike that's also incredibly profound, layered and really funny. It's the best version of itself and just immensely satisfying that the Barbie movie that got made on this scale is so weird and unique.Margot Robbie is perfect casting as Barbie, she nails the movement and switches between the eccentric Barbie Land and more emotionally tolling real world effortlessly. She has a terrific arc that's full of emotionally resonant moments and the almost parental nature with Gosling works beautifully.Ryan Gosling is phenomenal as Ken. Note perfect casting that gives him another welcome chance to move away from his usual introverted roles and tap into his impeccable comedic timing present in The Nice Guys, only here it's dialed up to eleven. It all culminates in a musical number that is painfully funny.Will Ferrell is essentially playing Lord Business again and him and his whole team of execs are just as cartoonish as the people in Barbie Land but it actually really works as a nice bit of satire that emphasises just how out of touch all of them are.America Ferrara gets one of the biggest speeches of the film and really makes it work and her relationship with Ariana Greenblatt adds a lot of heart to the film whilst allowing it to have its both ways when it comes to acknowledging the history of Barbie.Greta Gerwig's direction is excellent, getting the bigger budget she absolutely deserves and uses every penny. Magnificent dance numbers, a fun car chase and a Barbie Land that is as vibrant as possible and despite fully embracing its own artificial nature it feels more real and visually stunning than so much of what's out there.The soundtrack is another standout element, a great selection of songs from some of the best artists currently working all at the top of their game. Like the film, some are just really fun, some are very profound and every single one fits in effortlessly.",Barbie
8.0,"""Barbie"" - A Multifaceted Exploration of Femininity, Consumerism, and Existentialism",andypaps101,19 July 2023,"I got free tickets for a preview and to be honest I was more than a little embarrassed to go. I did not tell a soul. As a cool middle aged gentleman if word got out this could have really affected my street cred.Anyway, I embraced the journey and I'm glad that I did. Here is my review written as a pretentious critic that I aspire to be in my next life:In Greta Gerwig's latest directorial venture, ""Barbie,"" the esteemed filmmaker takes on the monumental task of unravelling the enigma that is Barbie, the iconic doll that has fascinated and polarized society for decades.With Margot Robbie as the eponymous character and Ryan Gosling as Ken, Gerwig's live-action rendition delves into the complex world of Barbie, attempting to extract deeper meaning from this cultural phenomenon.Gerwig masterfully navigates the treacherous waters of branded material, infusing the narrative with a blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. The result is a thought-provoking exploration of Barbie's role as a feminist symbol, challenging societal perceptions of femininity and girlhood.Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals?Gerwig compels the audience to contemplate this question, weaving it throughout the fabric of the film.In reality Margot Robbie dominated the film as expected and has developed into a true cinematic icon. The flm was fun and far above my expectations hence I'm giving it an 8 and boasting I watched Barbie.",Barbie
9.0,Nolan at his best!,shivamkanodia-94992,19 July 2023,"As VFX and special effects take over the traditional filmmaking methods, Nolan is among the remaining few directors who still builds grandiose true-to-life sets and reflects cinematic setpieces by filming them instead of digitising them. Oppenheimer is thus a culmination of Nolan's cinematic genius combined with an incredible story that changed the world in more ways than one. It's incredibly intimate and divisive, with the onus of it's justification being put on the audience instead of the narrator.The cast is just as incredible as you would expect it to be, and the screenplay flows naturally, with a breathtaking score that justifiably draws parallels from Hans Zimmer's profound work in Interstellar. Nolan balances the intimacy between the characters while simultaneously juxtaposing it with some of the most impactful scenes ever shown on the big screen. The movie's runtime takes it's time in setting up it's pieces, with the finale leaving you utterly spellbound at the sheer magnitude and scale of the events transpiring right in front of your eyes.Lastly, for those who want their daily dosage of immediate dopamine and faster pacing in the theatre instead of experiencing a meticulously guided journey, you could wait a few more months for yet another copy paste Fast and Furious flick or a Marvel movie laden with green backdrops and fan-service.Because this isn't a film or a flick, this is Cinema.",Oppenheimer
1.0,Phenomenally boring.,akeem-james,27 July 2023,"This movie pretentiously tries to be intellectual and intelligently made. However, it was over done.

Possibly we'll made if you invest in alternative and Eurocentric ideology.Over-hyped is the best way to describe this film.This film pulls on the heartstrings of those that yearn for another Gladiator, Schindler's List, Godfather 1 & 2.

Instead of showing, it tells you what to think in the last act of the movie.The only thing it has going for it is the set desing, wardrobe and music.Aside from tha the movie is plastic like the eponymous doll.The characters have no plot development, literal cliches.If you write characteres as abstractions , at least try to make into characters that are relatable to the viewer.Do not waste your time with this movie.",Barbie

This movie perfectly shows how the making of the A-bomb was one of the most important moments in the history of mankind The movie is understandable for everyone, even if you don't know much about the A-bomb it's an enjoyable movie.In my opinion this is one of the best movies of this decade.",Oppenheimer

Alot of jumping around.And the score overshadowed the dialog at times. So loud it seemed out of place.It's kind of like Dunkirk. Very underwhelmed considering the hype. For instance, the size and scope of the Los Alamos town wasn't portrayed very well, kind of like how the size and scope.of Dunkirk evacuation fell flat.Good not but not great. Enjoyed it but wouldn't see it again.",Oppenheimer
10.0,A Cinematic Masterpiece,uzair-97195,22 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a sweeping, epic biopic that tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist who led the Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. The film is a visual and intellectual tour-de-force, with Cillian Murphy giving a tour-de-force performance as Oppenheimer.The film begins with Oppenheimer as a young man, studying physics at Harvard. We see his early brilliance, his love of science, and his idealistic commitment to using his knowledge to make the world a better place. As the war progresses, Oppenheimer is recruited to lead the Manhattan Project, a top-secret effort to develop an atomic bomb. The film follows Oppenheimer as he leads this team of scientists, working day and night to create a weapon that could change the course of history.The film is not afraid to show the dark side of Oppenheimer's work. We see the moral and ethical dilemmas that he faces, as he grapples with the implications of creating a weapon of such destructive power. We also see the toll that this work takes on him, both physically and mentally.Oppenheimer is a complex and challenging film, but it is also a deeply rewarding one. It is a film that asks big questions about the nature of power, the responsibility of scientists, and the dangers of nuclear weapons. It is a film that will stay with you long after you have seen it.**10/10****Pros:*** Cillian Murphy's tour-de-force performance * Stunning visuals * Thought-provoking story * Powerful performances from the supporting cast * Christopher Nolan's masterful direction**Cons:*** The film is long (nearly three hours) * Some of the scientific jargon may be difficult to follow**Overall:**Oppenheimer is a must-see for fans of Christopher Nolan, Cillian Murphy, and historical dramas.

7.0,Christopher Nolan's Cinematic Bomb Blasts On And Off Screen,SAMTHEBESTEST,19 July 2023,"Oppenheimer (2023) : Movie Review -Oppenheimer Review : Christopher Nolan, one of the greatest filmmakers in the World with the most consistent filmography, brings a new cinematic treat, ""Oppenheimer"". Based on the life of a physicist named ""J. Robert Oppenheimer,"" this one is easily the most human-driven story ever told by Nolan. There is less action, more drama; there is less complexity, more tension; there is less soul, more characteristics, there is less everything of known-Nolan, but finally we have conversions in a Nolan movie. Oppenheimer is anything but a trademark Nolan film. When you look at his filmography, you see these things: Following was a low-budget banger with a classic twist; Memento is pathbreaking storytelling; Insomania is his attempt at psychological tension; Batman Begins is a revolution in the Superhero genre; The Prestige is a magical thriller; The Dark Knight is an Intellectual face off between the hero and the villain; Inception is a next-level sci-fi thriller; The Dark Knight Rises is a fulfilling send-off to the greatest superhero trilogy ever; Interstellar is an expansion of sci-fi Epic beyond infinity; Dunkirk is the most human-friendly and technically brilliant war drama; and Tenet is a fine example of time-breaking theme meeting groundbreaking visuals. After serving us something of the Nolan-fied genre in his every movie, the man finally enters the human drama genre, and how? If you think that Oppenheimer will be talking about the invention of the atom bomb and will take you to a laboratory to see the practicals behind its making, then you are wrong. Apparently, I was thinking of the same stuff, but I was wrong. The film is all about its title - Oppenheimer. It's the journey of a man who was excited to create a power that would make his country survive, but soon he realises that it is making some people lose their lives. The excitement, the trauma, the shivering, the lifelong guilt everything is there. There is blood on his hands, and he can't wash it. It's a textbook on Oppenheimer's life, but in a 3-hour brief. One thing is sure, after watching this film, you'll never forgive the name of J. Robert Oppenheimer, not because he achieved something in his life but because of what he lost.As we know, Nolan does not believe in simple linear equations, so he has a non-linear narration again. One of them runs in black and white, indicating that the world is colourless after the fruit has spread its fire all over the world, not just Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Lieutenant General Leslie Richard Groves (Matt Damon) trusts J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy) to create a miracle for the American Government. Robert is appointed director of the project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, tasked with developing the first nuclear weapons, four years after the start of the German nuclear weapons programme. Robert and the team achieve success at the Trinity test, and the president soon sends the bombs to be dropped on Japanese soil. Robert's celebration soon turns into a trauma, and he realises that the world might never be the same. He is framed for being a Soviet Spy, and the legal fight is not in his favour. How the most important man in the world at that time is trapped against the odds and how his acquaintances turn their backs on him is all that you get to see in the latter half.A three-hour runtime frightens me for sure, but not when the director is Nolan or Cameron. A three-hour movie does not feel boring, if it's Avatar 2 or Oppenheimer. The screenplay is on the job there, and it makes every minute worth it. Oppenheimer is pretty slow in the beginning as the characters are new and a lot of Robert's personnel are discussed on the screen. So he was a womaniser, a communist, and not a brilliant man, but do we have to see it all? And for so long? Oppenheimer loses the character's grip there. Robert's complicated illicit affair with Jean Tatlock (Florence Pugh) is too detailed and bare. I know a lot of Indians are curious to know whether that Bhagwadgita phrase is used in the film or not, so let me tell you, yes, it is used, and twice. The first use of ""I am become death, the destroyer of the world"" might offend some religious people here. It might even become a big controversy in our country today. In those old times, when they told us the biopics of legendary inventors with ""The Story of Louis Pasteur"" (1936), ""Edison The Man"" (1940), ""Dr. Ehrlich's Magic Bullet"" (1940), ""Madam Curie"" (1942), and a few others, they never showed the protagonist in a bad light. But that era is gone, and today we have to deal with several intimate facts that need to be shown in the film, so it's okay. The slow start does an effective trick to let us know the characters, but even 3 hours feels too short for them to fit well.Cillian Murphy is flawless as J. Robert Oppenheimer from start to end. You might have seen him in many good roles and solid performances, but this one surpasses them all. The tension, the fear, the excitement, the enthusiasm, the pressure, the guilt, and many more things, but this man carried full loads on his shoulder. Out of 3 hours, this guy hooks you to the screen for about 2 and a half hours, while all the others get half an hour of their own. It was such a big responsibility, and he did a great job. It's not just about facial expressions and dialogue delivery; Murphy had to look like Oppenheimer. For people who haven't seen Robert Oppenheimer in real life, Cillian Murphy is Robert Oppenheimer. Emily Blunt's shovelling testimony will win your heart, but there is nothing much to do for her there. He is there for 20 minutes, or maybe 30, but the way Robert Downey Jr. Has brought Lewis Strauss to the screen is simply amazing. Matt Damon's general is rough and tough, Josh Harnett's Lawrence is noticeable, Kenneth Branagh and Casey Affleck are fine, Rami Malek's cameo will have you clapping, and Tom Conti's Einstein is impeccable. Florence Pugh looks solid and drippy (as the character demands), while the big supporting cast of Benny Safdie, Dylan Arnold, Matthew Modine, Michael Angarano, Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, Olivia Thirlby, David Krumholtz, Dane DeHaan, David Dastmalchian, and others have been extremely encouraging.Oppenheimer is technically a powerful film, but not as great as some of Nolan's previous works. The background score will have your heart pumping Faster on many occasions, and that disturbing score with lapses will have your throat choked. Watch out for the Trinity test sequences and Oppenheimer's testimony scene, and I am 100% sure you are gonna be blown away by the impact of the BGM. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is very fine, especially the nuke scene. Nolan usually believes in practical effects and 2D viewing, and he also made this film without any CGI segments. Oppenheimer does not have anything groundbreaking as such, but the realistic effects do work on the IMAX screen. For instance, the bomb explosion scene. You expect it to be loud from the start, but you get a low sound and literally silence there. It makes practical sense, as we know sound takes time to travel, and by the time it reaches you, you are completely unaware of its existence. That's a masterstroke. A technical brilliance that everyone should notice. Christopher Nolan's storytelling goes through a change here. As mentioned above, Oppenheimer has nothing stone-breaking to offer, and frankly, it gets confusing sometimes with the new characters talking about something terribly new that you aren't aware of, but it's such a pleasure to see Nolan trying a simple human story with his extraordinary vision, of course. Robert's speech scene after the successful bomb test is artistically wonderful. The man has to speak about celebration and all happy things, and he does that, but his inner world is destroyed in those moments. How to describe two different emotions, happiness and sadness, at the same time is what you learn from Master Nolan here. See that framework, man. Oppenheimer is about Nolan attempting a complete character study, and for this reason, it is a must-see. The feel of the docudrama takes away the mass appeal of the film, but did Nolan ever care about that chunk of audiences? No. He didn't. He has his own audience, which is smart enough to understand his cinema. That's what you get here. Nolan's latest cinematic bomb blasts on the screen and leaves you burning off screen with its traumatic consequences. One bomb blasts there on the big screen, and the other one blasts outside the screen-that's inside you.RATING - 7/10*",Oppenheimer
10.0,Cillian Murphy Steals The Show,gxp-85709,19 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan can be immensely proud of the overall performances of all of his cast in 'Oppenheimer', however a certain Mr Murphy, stands out.From the get go, the film sets the tempo of which Nolan is known for - you're hanging on the edge of your seat, sweating and gripping the handles. We all know the eventual outcome of the science that goes on in this film but it really does make you think 'what if'... the risks taken to proceed with the project were straight insanity.Nolan needs to stick to this era, he smashed it with 'Dunkirk' and now 'Oppenheimer' continues a great trend. Perhaps Nolan could next venture into the Vietnam war or even WW1?Must see movie!!",Oppenheimer
2.0,How very on brand!! Style over substance...,wyannjameson,21 July 2023,"Making a movie is hard. Super hard. Making one for a huge IP to sell the hell of of merchandise- even harder. But, for approx $150M, this should have been SO much better, in every way.Where it really struggled was with its thin narrative and ACTUAL character development. From a story crafting perspective it's all over the place and spends too much time fighting for cheap laughs (ahem, extra cheap) instead of developing a story around what the human experience is vs. The idea of doll-like perfection. It claws to be profound and existential, but never develops past gender stereotypes. As if GENDER bias was ever the issue with Barbie?! Let's talk about female expectations, expressions, and our evolution!It somehow managed to still feel shallow, which ironically was what the script wanted to subvert. Creating something that's nuanced and not heavy handed takes real craft. This wasn't craft, it was a CASH grab.No go buy all the merchandise, cuz... capitalism!!",Barbie
8.0,Fun and surprisingly touching,jpismyname,19 July 2023,"I was honestly doubting this movie at first, but surprisingly I find myself really liking it quite a lot.Set in the colorful Barbie Land, stereotypical Barbie lives a perfect life every single day. One day, she shows signs of being...a human. She decides to go to the Real World to find the cure in order to make herself perfect again.Barbie is a fun movie that has surprisingly plenty of heartwarming moments and good messages to offer. The set designs are eye-catching and on point as well. Both Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling nailed their parts, but it is Gosling who mostly shines.Something I'm pretty sure of is this movie getting nominated for the Oscars, most likely for Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and probably Best Song for Billie Eilish. That song is beautiful and it's stuck in my head right now.",Barbie
7.0,"Fun soundtrack , story a bit confusing",luffha,23 July 2023,"I loved the music , and the fun start.A bit of cheeky humor , and dance choreography.The story was quite confusing, it felt like being glued with superglue and not consistent from the beginning to the end . The ending was quite weird . And switching between the two worlds of the story did not make much sense . The character from the Mattel management did not add any value to the story . If they were edited out , I think no one would even notice a difference .The main male character has done a good job , especially in his macho phase .The female main character was lovely . Absolutely gorgeous and well played .",Barbie
9.0,NOSTALGIA,valfrae,23 July 2023,"This movie is NOT what I expected at all. I thought it would be your average formulaic movie, but no. This movie is deep. It explores topics such as feminism & the patriarchy, femininity, existentialism, and a lot more. It uses incredible comedy to make its points, and hence, doesn't come across preachy at all.Greta Gerwig is absolutely incredible, this is 100% her best work so far. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling did a splendid job, as did the rest of the supporting characters.Also, the nostalgia you'll feel when you watch this movie is insane. It's so crazy how similar every girl's Barbie play-stories are. I love that I'm just like other girls!!",Barbie
5.0,"A cold, long history lesson",apereztenessa-1,23 July 2023,"Oppenheimer's marketing campaign hammered two messages into our heads. First, that we had to watch it in the biggest screen possible. And second, that audiences had come out of test projections deeply affected or in tears. Having watched the film, I can confidently say none of those promises are true.For a Christopher Nolan film, Oppenheimer is very unspectacular, with only a handful of atomic explosion images, which -unfortunately- are not new and will not impact anyone in the audience. And it's also quite unemotional. You leave the theatre feeling like you just went through a (rather long) history lesson, but not particularly devastated. Because the film chooses -as is often the case with Nolan- a clinical approach to its subject, and the contradictions and dilemmas of Oppenheimer are observed the way one observes an insect, instead of a human character. It looks as if Nolan were trying to compete in intelligence with the scientists in his film. This is Nolan's consistent flaw. He is so insecure that he is only happy when he has proven to everyone how intelligent he is. To do this, in addition to the ice cold way in which he treats his characters, he throws into Oppenheimer his signature mixing of time periods, always afraid people will see him as mediocre if he ever just followed the chronological order of events. And in this case, he adds black and white to one of the time periods of the movie, which makes the whole thing a little cheesy.But as always too, Nolan shows control of the medium, and delivers some strong moments with virtuoso camera movements, broad shots and a great score. Most enjoyable in the film is the performance of its extraordinary cast. Every last one of them is outstanding, starting with Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer.The balance is a bit of an average film, undeniably very long and a bit boring, despite the talent of the filmmaker and the cast.",Oppenheimer
8.0,"""Sex Education"" with Barbies",i_odin,23 July 2023,"Greta Gerwig's Barbie is perhaps one of the most ambitious film in recent history. The fact that a filmmaker decides to make a film on such an idea which is equally popular and problematic is brave.It is both a celebration as well as a quip on the Barbie world. Barbie deals with the modern day gender issues and how Barbie (the company) stands as a symbol of all those issues. At the same time it cleverly portrays the emotions involved of all those who love and admire this pop symbol.Margot Robbie is excellent as Barbie. Her performance range is phenomenal. Gerwig uses her aptly. Gosling is cute and is being judiciously used for his charm and handsome vulnerability that he brings. All the supporting casts (most of them are from just one show hence the title of this review) have done their job well. Can't say I am particularly impressed by any one though as there isn't much for them to do. Although Will Ferrel and America Ferrera are an exception as they shines in their limited appearance and steal the show.The music, production design and direction along with Baumbach's writing is outrageously entertaining and often funny as well. The bizarre world of Barbie will be loved not just by the ones who carry a nostalgic baggage of playing with one in their childhood but also to those who have never ever heard about it. Such is the charm of this movie.",Barbie
10.0,This movie has changed me and I am not sure how to process it,timryansvensk,28 July 2023,"Oppenheimer was absolutely phenomenal. It is hard to know exactly how I am going to deal with having seen it, probably by seeing it again and again. Having seem it in IMAX (as it is supposed to be viewed) was totally worth it.I assume those who see it are fairly familiar with at least the broad storyline which makes it better when you now get to see it from Oppenheimer's own perspective. You get to follow his experiences regarding the process and see how it affects him as a person.The acting, the writing, the score... everything was done to perfection and Cillian Murphy should be praised for his portrayal of this troubled physicist. The only thing I have to say to those who have not yet seen it is: do it.",Oppenheimer
9.0,"The brilliance of human Art, shows a true true evil of men.",pob2471011,21 July 2023,"The film lays out a journey of humanity's character that which we've never recovered. Powerful evils are perpetrated by such noble ""idealism"" from either side & the ""good"" versus evil debates remain only for the winners to portray the virtues of their side. It's a sickening gut wrenching film of such unimaginable horrors behinds it's subject matter of 2 dropped bombs never explained nor given detail. Only by the films very existence will humanity have yet another example of humankind's ""art"" ego telling war horror for entertainment, no idealism, no whimsical warnings, instead this seems instead a truth. Our very worst imaginings are only outdone by those with the power & ego to forgo their soul to achieve anything for nothing but horror. :Macbeth Tomorrow Tomorrow Tomorrow....",Oppenheimer
10.0,"If perfection were something from this world, it would certainly be directed by Nolan",Ralifax,20 July 2023,"I don't even know where to begin.Not every director can bring out the best in a star-studded cast, but that's definitely not the case with Nolan.It's a true pleasure to be alive and witness his work, along with Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., and many others giving their best.The film's cinematography is one of the best I've ever seen, from the set design to the screenplay, sound, and costumes; everything borders on perfection in the most literal sense.Few movies bring to the senses, even to those less familiar with the art of cinematography, such distinct aspects of audiovisual elements.The only negative aspect is that at some point, the movie ends.Can't wait to watch It more times.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Excellent ensemble,JankiSharma,24 July 2023,"Movie Oppenheimer by Director Christopher Nolan is excellent. The screenplay, acting, Direction has rekindled interest in Physics and thought process of making of atomic bomb in 1940s. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss did a great job. Matt Damon as Leslie Groves ,an engineer from MIT who went to West Point and as Lieutenant General who oversaw Manhattan project , is excellent. Emily Blunt as bored homemaker and mother of 2 kids is perfect as Oppenheimer's wife. Florence Pugh as Oppenheimer's physical weakness is good. The movie is 3 hr long and could be edited without losing content and high quality of ensemble and Direction.My favorite movie of Christopher Nolan is/was Dunkirk and now Oppenheimer ... great movie.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Fun & Creative,vectro589,21 July 2023,"Barbie movies have always been an embodiment of women empowerment and creativity in the Barbie beautifully continues this tradition.

4.0,This movie tries to be too much,brianjohnson-20043,24 July 2023,"I wanted to like it. But I just didn't. The story wasn't very compelling to me because it seemed as if the entire point of much of the movie was to provide learning moments for viewers with some slapstick comedy and quick-delivery comedy. The story itself should nearly always be more important.All of the goofiness largely would have been excused to me if the comedic moments were really funny. And the way this film was hyped made me think it was going to be super funny. But I rarely laughed. And that's even more of a shame given the talent assembled for the cast. There also weren't many surprising reveals to the audience when maybe there could have been if things were presented differently.I also found it annoying to see Will Farrell play a similar part to what he played in the Lego Movie. Sure he's a CEO rather than a dad. But he was filling the same evil disciplinarian adult role for a movie about a kid's toy. It just felt lazy to not cast someone else for that part, and just made me wish the movie was able to provide the humor and intrigue that the first Lego movie provided to its audience.I'd rather this film felt like a comedy or dramatic experience which has some relevant takes on feminism and culture than thinly veiled sermon with occasional jokes that land amongst a ton that didn't land.I also felt like the movie had way too many characters and ideas thrown together. There was Barbie, Ken, many other Barbies, many other Kens, the crazy Barbie, the CEOs, the mother, the teen, the narrator and more. And it's not just that they had all of these characters. They also tried to have some learning moments delivered-by or delivered-to a majority of these characters. I felt like they would have been better off trying to deliver all these lessons over 3-5 movies rather than 1. And obviously you don't want it ever to seem like the lessons are being delivered but experiences through the story and the consequences of the actions and stakes created by the characters' decisions. Instead there didn't seem like any stakes because the Barbies didn't seem to fit in the real world and the real people didn't fit in the Barbie world.Honestly my favorite part of the movie was a lot of the Easter egg stuff about odd Barbie products over the years. And Easter eggs shouldn't be the best part of any movie. They should be a bonus to the overall experience of the story.",Barbie
10.0,You've never seen a film like Oppenheimer,eddie_baggins,24 July 2023,"It's taken me a few days to be able to sit down and write down my thoughts about Christoper Nolan's newest big screen epic, the other part of the now infamous ""Barbenheimer"" double bill that has been re-writing record books over there launch weekends, having had this time to ponder and contemplate I am confident in saying that I've never seen a film quite like this biopic and while it's a film with flaws and components that don't stick their respective landings, Nolan's film is nevertheless a powerful, poignant and technically marvellous piece of original film-making that further establishes the esteemed director as a generational talent whose skill set is unrivalled.It's incredible to think that a three hour dialogue heavy expose of a theoretical physicist and the creation of the worlds first atomic bomb could become a film that is being viewed on such a scale that Oppenheimer is currently playing too and while it's clearly been enhanced by the fact Nolan's heavy hitting drama has been partnered alongside the pink behemoth that's Barbie, there's also no denying that audiences are hungry for original content that gives them something more than just another run of the mill experience and that's exactly what Oppenheimer does.Told in a typical Nolan like fashion that refuses to play out in a manner that could said to be stereotypical, Oppenheimer operates in multiple timelines and requires audiences to pay close attention to who is who but despite covering immense ground and delving into far more than just Oppenheimer's past, present and future or the bomb he was responsible for bringing into existence, Nolan's film never becomes too complicated or overbearing as clever direction, editing and script work ensures that its three hour runtime will grip anyone willing to go along with it, creating an utterly engaging and even white knuckle experience that is the very definition of what cinema is all about.Lead by a long overdue and awards worthy turn from Cillian Murphy as the titular figure, who is ably supported by a string of A-listers that most notably includes key performances from the likes of Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's long-suffering wife Kitty, Matt Damon as military head honcho Leslie Groves and Robert Downey Jr. In a scene stealing performance as Lewis Strauss, Oppenheimer is all class on screen as Nolan juggles one of the most stacked ensemble casts of the modern era and while some of his big name performers might only get mere minutes of screentime, each and every one of them brings their A-game to what must surely be regarded as Nolan's most noteworthy feature yet based on performances.Outside of this aspect of Nolan's masterwork is the technical elements of this big budget affair that includes an unforgettable score by Ludwig Göransson, exemplary editing by Jennifer Lame, beautiful cinematography from the increasingly impressive Hoyte Van Hoytema and sound mixing/editing from Nolan's team that ensures despite the fact Oppenheimer is very much focused in on the people at the heart of the story, so much of the film still feels like a grand cinematic offering and there are moments within Nolan's opus that are likely to remain some of the most memorable cinematic moments of recent times, none more so than the breathtaking detonation test scene that left my particular screening as silent as a field mouse.I have no doubt that like many of Nolan's films in the past decade detractors and naysayers will turn their attention to singling out elements of Nolan's film that may be considered weak points and while there's going to be further debate about the sound mix of this film and Nolan's films as a whole, that at times have their dialogue drowned out by the score or other aspects of the mix or the debate that rages about Nolan's ability to connect on the human level, that is on show here with a strangely cold romantic element between Murphy and Blunt and also with Florence Pugh's Jean Tatlock (not due to performances, more so development) but allowing your gaze to be directed into these areas as a main point of focus is robbing one of the experience they could otherwise have.Building to a crescendo that is both surprising, haunting and unforgettable, it's unlikely that you will soon forget Oppenheimer, a beautifully staged biopic that is also so many other things all at once, where Oppenheimer ranks amongst all of Nolan's work will take some time to decide but what's undeniable is the fact Nolan has once more proved original film-making is alive and well, should one take the time and care to bring it too life.Final Say -A film that feels unlike any before it, Oppenheimer is a big screen epic that is both grand and intimate, thrilling and confronting and a further addition to the growing legacy of Christoper Nolan to be regarded as one of the most important voices in cinematic history.5 bowls of marbles out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",Oppenheimer

6.0,Nolan fatigue,BlueBird84,24 July 2023,"Fantastic performances. Cillian deserves an Oscar. Great cinematography and score. Stellar casting. Gorgeous effects. Very effective portrayal of the frenetic pace of the Manhattan Project and the existential dread that comes along with the invention of these terrible weapons.There are several flaws that are often present in Nolan's films. Swelling score drowning out important dialogue. Artificially fast-paced and complex dialogue filled with smug jargon. Unnecessarily complicated plots. The latter two are especially, unforgivably egregious in Oppenheimer without Nolan's well-shot action scenes to distract from them.There is no reason to be jumping between different timelines, there is no reason for so many characters, and there is no reason for Strauss' plot to be actually portrayed on screen rather than just alluded to. This is an 8/10 film dragged down to a 6/10 because Nolan thinks he's too clever for us mere mortals and is determined to shove a miniseries' worth of content into a theatrical film. I never say this about Nolan films but there really is no reason to see Oppenheimer in IMAX. It's 95% people talking to each other.I have long suspected that Nolan would be better served by making big-budget miniseries and Oppenheimer confirms that.",Oppenheimer

Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are brilliantly cast as Barbie and Ken where they both have awesome chemistry and share plenty of hilarious moments on-screen. I should also add that Gosling delivers what's probably one of the best musical solos of the year next to Jack Black's performance in The Super Mario Bros Movie.""Barbie"" is not only an eccentric, goofball comedy but also a thought-provoking film with a post-feminist take on gender roles and gender stereotypes in current society, something highly reminiscent of movies such as ""The Ugly Truth"" or ""Down With Love."" On that note, America Ferrera's powerful monologue near the end of ""Barbie"" was on par with Renée Zellweger's speech in ""Down With Love.""While the above description might make it sound like the Barbie movie leans too much into polemics for it to be good escapist fun then don't worry, because aside from its core message, it's still oodles of light-hearted, hilarious entertainment for everyone to enjoy from beginning to end.",Barbie
10.0,"Deserves all the hype and all the accolades in the future! Oscars, here we come!",aadarshstha-92565,21 July 2023,"A cinematic spectacle. Oppenheimer is yet another masterclass filmmaking and storytelling from non other than, Christopher Nolan and he has crafted one of the greatest biopics of all time.In his own words, ""J. Robert Oppenheimer, the most important person who ever lived"". This film has exceptional storytelling and mad genius cinematography. Christopher Nolan is a very intelligent person himself, he has proven it since his first film, Following and have given such thought-provoking films like Memento, The Prestige, The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar and Tenet. With this, Nolan has proven to be a master at filmmaking taking inspiration from the 2005 book, American Prometheus.This film fires dialogue packed with historical information at a relentless pace and jumps to various times in Oppenheimer's life continuously (from his own perspective as well as Lewis Strauss' perspective) throughout it's 3 hour runtime. The star-studded cast gives phenomenal performance, even a small role has been done by the big name in Hollywood; this proves how big of a name is Nolan and how actors would do anything to work with him.The career best performance from Cillian Murphy must be the highlight of the film but I was really surprised with the final act and how important of a role is of Mr. Downey Jr. The final hour of the film must be the most intense in the film about the atomic bomb. As it unravels, my heart was pounding out of my chest!Aesthetically beautiful cinematography, exceptional performance and terrifying soundtracks.I was stunned looking at the visuals. A great milestone for film industry, as a whole. This film will be remembered throughout, at least for it's visual milestone.",Oppenheimer
9.0,The Most Moving Film I've Ever Seen,nicholaskutzin,23 July 2023,"I'm not even joking when I say this was the most moving film I've ever seen. Going into this I expected the outcome to be one of two things: either is was going to be very dumb and bad, or it would be absolutely amazing. No in between. And now, I can confidently say that it was absolutely amazing. It made me laugh, it made me tear up, it made me feel so much more than I ever could have expected a movie about Barbies, or any toys in general, to make me feel. I genuinely believe that it is going to be one of the most influential movies of this generation.Before I get into why specifically I loved it so much, I would like to first say that to the men out there that are calling this movie ""man-hating,"" you could not be more wrong. If you think that, then clearly you went in with your own preconceived notions and did not pay enough attention to the message of the movie. I also am a man and this movie delivered a beautifully written feminist message that depicted unfair societal stereotypes placed onto women and proved the reasons why the patriarchy is truly a bad thing. Just because it did that, does not make it man-hating, especially since it also depicted and drew awareness to negative societal pressure placed onto men and their emotions.Now, onto why I really loved this movie. First off, it was very funny and light hearted at exactly the right points. I liked that it left room for dramatic scenes that could really tug at the heart strings and Margot Robbie in particular delivered a very powerful performance. Yes, she had great comedic timing, but her talent really showed in more emotional scenes where Barbie felt she had to still act like her happy smiley self despite the overwhelming sadness she was feeling. Not only that, but the costumes and sets were immaculate. It was not only well written and acted, but clearly a lot of care went into the movie from the crew. Each character, even despite their limited screen time, was fleshed out and everyone did a great job making their characters unique and different from each other.This movie made me think so much. I had to let it fester in my brain for a few days before writing a review because I had so many thoughts. I know many people wished it was more light hearted at times, but I am so glad it wasn't, because if it was, it never could have been as powerful and emotional for me. The writers and directors could have taken a more silly, childish approach, but instead they decided upon a story that could make the world a better place, and I have to commend that.Overall, the Barbie Movie was so much more than I ever could have expected it to be and I urge anyone who hasn't yet to go watch it, especially if you have an open mind and, most importantly, an open heart. As of right now, my rating is a 9/10, but I definitely think it will increase once I inevitably watch it again. I think this movie has the potential to do a lot of good for the world.",Barbie
8.0,Do the means justify the end?,EdwardtheBlackPrince,21 July 2023,"Oppenheimer has always been regarded by History as an interesting figure for the advancement of scientific discovery. While also being a rather controversial figure for his choices and mankind. Nolans Oppenheimer takes the audience on that dramatic epic of ethical proportions, in many ways, it is conflicting yet still fantasizing in every way Throughout the movie, you see the psyche and internal conflict, personal Matters left facing. The themes of the era with the red scare with McCarthyism, the paranoia and the shadow hanging over following Oppenheimer throughout. What the influence of such a weapon carries? The pressure put on a man. If the possibility of the enemy having such a thing, is it better to act before they do? Are the ones who claim to fight for you the ones to trust themselves? This is a movie about Mankind, not just the bomb being built, or the overall progress much of the war. Much like say The Imitation Game focusing on the war being fought behind the battle line. This is a very heavy dialogue-driven focus on the aspects of science and politics, and the psychological of Oppenheimer, but all of this things investing as you jump around these different time frames. Primary because of the great reforming given by like Cillian Murphy, Matt Damon, and Robert Downey who gives probably the second-best performance in this ensemble cast. With most of his films, the cinematography is done amazingly as well as the visuals that emphasize of fission and chain reactions of the panning landshot the use of and the lack of color, and of course the big payoff of the bomb and the impact of all, and the Explosions Performances that on the big screen can't be compared to watching it at home.",Oppenheimer
7.0,Heavy duty marketing,nathaliacardozo,21 July 2023,"The movie was very good. It had comic moments, impeccable costumes and exceptional acting, as well as necessary political dialogues. However, despite these strengths, the ending was disjointed and poorly crafted, leaving a sense of dissatisfaction. It felt like the filmmakers were struggling to find a cohesive resolution, resulting in a lackluster conclusion that did not do justice to the well-crafted narrative. While the movie has its merits, the disappointing ending prevents me from considering watching it again. However, it is worth recognizing the film's strengths and the thought-provoking discussions it initiated.",Barbie
4.0,Felt like a TV series recap of Highlights,hvqgscct,26 July 2023,"Why did it feel like a huge tv series recap of thrown together highlights to give you the back story of the next season lol! Felt like a super long trailer! After 20 mins I was thinking hope it's starts soon, after 1 hour ""when is this film going to start?"" After a few hours in I was bored and looking at the time.I love Christopher Nolan. Love! And have from the beginning, memento to inception, the Batman's to interstellar. The guy is a genius. And has blown the world away.But...Look let's all just be super realistic right now and honest with ourselves. This film was not it! Okay if you truly loved it and it was the movie you needed in your life and it satisfied all your expectations and gave you hope in cinema again, I'm super happy for you and glad you enjoyed it. But you have got to be in the minority of people, because I think people will just say it's awesome out of respect to the big names. It was just so messy and was trying to hard. Just give us the story! Build your characters! And let the actors act! Let us actually feel something! If you want to do it artsy then give us a 'there will be blood' vibe! I personally would like to know the history and the people of what happened and to actually feel something about this crazy time of the world but it was done in such I just didn't feel much.And it was in fact ...Boring.Okay I'm not movie expert but I love cinema, im actually a video editor so it's a huge part of my life, I'm not an immature film lover who needs all the super fake unrealistic garbage that gets thrown out these days. So I was super hyped for this one. But this film was boring! Interesting at times and a few things I liked. But if we are doing a film about nuclear bombs let us be full of fear like they must have been, give us the true horrific truth about setting off a nuclear bomb.Anyway Glad people enjoyed it. Hope CN brings more films out soon. I just hope someone comes and saves movies and we walk into a time of unbelievable films. Because I'm just tired and actually want to be entertained.",Oppenheimer
9.0,I certainly hope this film will be a wake-up call,karifreyr03,20 July 2023,"I read the book on which the movie was based, and this film is exactly as I imagined it, and it was almost perfect yet as good as it will ever get.Nolan skipped some of my favorite parts of the story and narrative, but he kept the important ones and those that were significant to Oppies' personal life.I'm pretty sure that this film will get mixed reviews because it is definitely not for everyone because it is so dialogue-heavy, and to get the right picture of the narrative, you'll pretty much have to listen carefully to every single word that is said in the film. Second of all, I think the film might be confusing because of its constant shifting between three continuous storylines that take place years apart from one another.I certainly hope this film will be a wake-up call for the masses about how a war in the present is way deadlier than prior to the historical events that the film depicts.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Nolan's Best Film Ever,connormanf,22 July 2023,"This film is unlike anything I've ever seen. From start to finish, Nolan's directing and screenwriting, cinematography, and more makes one of the most ambitious, important and beautiful film of all times.An IMAX experience is essential to experience this to the fullest. Fast paced and perfectly paced at the same time. Even the scenes of discussion feel like they are moving fast.Cillian Murphy's performance will win an Oscar.Robert Downey Jr. And Matt Damon both also deliver Oscar worthy performances.This movie will sweep the academy in February.Safe to say, this is one of the greatest films of all time.",Oppenheimer
1.0,Worst movie ever,deveshkedia-46043,24 July 2023,"I have to express my disappointment with this movie, as it is riddled with an overwhelming number of loopholes and plot holes that hinder the overall viewing experience. It's quite disheartening to find that there is a noticeable absence of a compelling and engaging story, leaving the audience wanting more substance and coherence.Frankly, I cannot help but think that investing time in watching this film is not the best use of one's entertainment hours. Instead, I would suggest diverting attention to purchasing a Barbie doll, allowing for a more enjoyable and imaginative playtime experience.In conclusion, I find it regrettable that this movie fails to live up to expectations, and I consider it to be an utter waste of valuable time and cinematic potential.",Barbie
7.0,Nolan could have used the 'less is more' principle,c-mik-shridhar,23 July 2023,"There's just too much stuff going on. I would have preferred lesser information, lesser number of characters and lesser timeline switching.And what I would have wanted more was... more time with (lesser number of) characters... their backstories, their motivations.Overall, I didn't FEEL much in the movie. I didn't feel the dilemmas, the dangers, the urgencies, the betrayals with those characters. I wasn't rooting for anyone, I wasn't really against anyone.I actually did enjoy the bomb explosion, not because it was like the best visual ever, in fact it was not... I enjoyed it because I just new it was a real explosion. That made it interesting. Never really looked at a real life explosion with such details before. So, thanks for that. :)All in all I'm still glad I watched the movie. But I wish I had gone to see the movie after reading some bad reviews. My high expectations probably made the whole thing a bit more disappointing.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Kenough,Aziz24,23 July 2023,"Synopsis: Barbie (Played by Margot Robbie) suddenly starts to notice that she is slowly turning away from being the stereotypical Barbie doll with a few changes happening to her. This forces Barbie to discover the real world as well as herself and her purpose as a doll.This film is directed by Greta Gerwig and written by both Greta Gerwig and her partner Noah Baumbach. In case you did not know, Greta Gerwig is the writer and director of films like Lady Bird (2017) and Little Woman (2018). Both these films are astonishing in terms of the screenplay and dialogues. In addition, Noah Baumbach wrote, directed, and produced Marriage Story (2019) as well as Frances Ha (2012) that had Greta Gerwig as a lead actress role and a writer in the film. Both those films also stood out for mostly the screenplay that is very deep and realistic in terms of the story and dialogues. Therefore, the expectations of Barbie are very high especially that we are talking about having those big names as the filmmakers behind this film. However, the results are unfortunately not near their previous films, especially in-terms of the screenplay.Barbie is a film that is in my opinion targeted mostly for adults. It is like the director described, ""a party for everyone, and everyone is invited"". But, young kids (especially today's new young generation) will feel like it's not the type of party for them. As well as the jokes that feel like mostly adults will get them, especially that some of them include some inappropriate language or idea.The biggest flaws of the film are its most important parts, and the main story mainly evolves around them. Therefore, because they weren't done well, the film lost its balance at most times. Barbie touched on the topic of how a relationship between a mother and a daughter can be and the stages it goes through. This is being portrayed in the weakest way ever and that's due to many reasons mainly for not giving it enough time and discussing it very briefly. Therefore, no emotions or connections are created between both the mother's character and the daughter's character with audience members. As well as, using a young actress to portray the role of the daughter that can be played by someone else with better acting skills. Without spoiling, but, a shorter sequence near the end of the film between 2 irrelevant characters, was able to touch audience members' hearts in terms of that topic, better than the characters of the mother and daughter with their sequences that we spent nearly most of the film with trying to connect with their relationship. A huge aspect that had helped in making this sequence a successful one is Billie Eilish's song ""What was I made for"" that was playing in the background during it. I an interview wit Billie, she goes by explaining how this song tells what she went through and felt in an. This can be heard in the song's lyrics and Billie's voice that makes this scene and song very real and original and goes so well with that scene in particular.Another huge flaw is the portrait of the Mattel corporation with its executives, mainly played by Will Farrell as the CEO of Mattel. Very weak, and cringe at times that just made me rather want to go back to the BarbieLnad sequences or Barbie and Ke sequences.Margot Robbie is just phenomenal as Barbie exactly like what everyone expected her to be. She proves herself as an actress that can be added to the list of one of the most significant actresses in the modern time. She is able to play most roles very well and that can be seen from her previous roles like Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad (2016), Sharon Tate in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019), or previously in Babylon (2022) as Nillie Lorey. On the other hand, Ryan gosling as Ken is shining in this film. I think most of the scenes that I laughed out loud in, where mostly because of jokes performed by Gosling with the help of his acting skills using facial expressions and body language that suits Ken's character and behaviour perfectly. Simu Lui proves himself in this film that he is better in comedy films rather than serious action drama films. I enjoyed his comedic Ken role here more tHan i enjoyed seeing him being a superhero and trying to play a character like Shang-Chu in marvel's Shang-Chi (2021).Greta really uses all the memes and trends that people have created in regards to the Barbie movie on the different social media platforms, and uses them as the main core behind the comedy aspect of the film. These little details are what make Greta's films all different from each other. Also, this is what makes Barbie a film made for the fans specifically. For instance, everyone have seen the meme that is a picture of the gang from Goodfellas wearing suits and looking very fresh, with a caption on it that says: ""4 tickets for the Barbie movie please"". This can clearly be seen in the film as many jokes had a similar idea that evolves around those jokes that you would end to your buddy on Tik Tok or Insta. One of my favourite lines said by Ryan Gosling's Ken is: ""Every night is boys' night"".Finally, props to all production design, custom design and editing team that was able to portray BarbieLand and all the different Barbie and Ken versions exactly how they were suppose to look with their pink and colourful world and customs which is a thing that I personally was worried about. The results are more than ""KENough""My rating is 8/10Watched on July 20th, 2023 Format: Ultra AVX.",Barbie
8.0,When Particle Worlds Collide...,Xstal,26 July 2023,"In a world that's problematic you're perplexing, spending your time with particles, that are complexing, pushing boundaries to their limits, the fission/fusion of new physics, with the clashes, conflicts, contests you elicit. As a consequence you setup two big bangs, when you execute through governmental plans, although this story does not dwell, on the hell that you propel, to the people who are wiped out in Japan.

8.0,This isn't the movie you think it is - and it's probably better for it.,I_Ailurophile,27 July 2023,"Any time a movie prioritizes messaging, there's an all too long history of the end result suffering, whether in terms of its storytelling, its general craftsmanship, or both. Broadly, this trend holds true even when a message is important, admirable, and agreeable. Case in point, last year's slasher 'They/them' was troubled in various ways, but above all in how immensely upfront it was about its otherwise gratifying messaging; sure enough, the writing suffered in turn. This 2023 film is not free of that same issue, for it is extremely, emphatically forthright and downright strident about the ideas at the root of the screenplay and which it wishes to convey; they're terrific ideas, but literally from the very beginning we see and hear exactly, indisputably, what the script wants to communicate. More than that, this is a picture that strives to be, say, and do a lot, and in fact it is, says, and does so much that it's a little overwhelming - I earnestly think the finished product would have benefited from some thoughts being left out so as to tighten the whole and assert greater focus. And though I somewhat repeat myself, it's well worth accentuating that the feature is majorly heavy-handed, with astonishingly little of the content being given a delicate, nuanced touch for the viewer to pick up on or feel for ourselves. It's a title that wears its neon pink heart on its sleeve, and there's no possibility of missing it.And yet what's truly amazing is that for all this, 'Barbie' is also a movie that is incredibly, exceptionally smart. I can't readily think of any other title that was so predominantly blunt, gawky, and straightforward in its presentation, but which simultaneously impressed with the absolute supreme intelligence behind everything that's being shoved in our faces. Within the slant of being overfull and immoderate, it's nevertheless remarkably well-rounded and balanced. Everything it endeavors to be, say, and do is treated with that same frank hand, and all is blended together into a slurry where no facet is allowed to especially outshine the others. It bounces from trenchantly triumphant to awesomely artificial, to wildly wacky, to dourly dispiriting, to honestly heartfelt, to satisfyingly sincere, and back again, but the progression still feels natural and meaningful, not to mention purposeful, and we never experience whiplash. It is entirely unabashed about the values it wields like a flaming sword of vengeance, and the themes that serve as its very blood: feminism, independence, denunciation of patriarchy and toxic masculinity; self-discovery and self-realization outside any strict confines or definitions that are forced upon or underhandedly given to us, or which we unwittingly construct for ourselves; the need to be active agents of our own liberation, active defenders of what we wish to build, and active stewards of what we wish to maintain - and much, much more. Then, too, it plainly champions diversity even in just the casting, but ultimately acknowledges the advisable place and just importance of diversity, and equality, in governance and representation; touches upon the evils of capitalism, and also the multifaceted elements of what Mattel's signature doll represents, for good and for ill; recognizes that women, who can and should be anything they want, can be and may want to be mothers, too. It's not inaccurate to say that 'Barbie' acts to upholds what are commonly seen as leftist or humanist ideals, yet those who decry the feature as part of some subversive agenda either haven't actually seen it, or can't discern the immediately transparent notion that values that seek a better, more equitable world for everyone can only be said to be dangerous insofar as they threaten those values that work to sustain inequality and injustice.Meanwhile, setting aside the writing which is so enormously essential to all that this is, the film is stupendously well done in every other regard. The cast is a blast, simply put, obviously all having a fantastic time - but for as weird and widely varied as the parts and scenes may be, everyone also gives excellent performances no less worthy of appreciation than anything else that any of them have done. It rather goes without saying that Margot Robbie is altogether luminous as the stereotypical protagonist, but I personally am also very happy to see Hari Nef here so prominently, and Kate McKinnon is an outright joy. The crew put in magnificent work in every last regard, from spellbinding, colorful sets, to bewitching costume design, to impeccable hair and makeup, and more. Editing, cinematography, direction, sound, stunts, effects: I do not jest when I say that everything here looks fabulous. The music is a wonderfully fun garnish that I in no way anticipated, and all who contributed to the soundtrack in any way are to be congratulated; those instances of choreography that we see are utterly superb, providing a level of glee that I'd have never supposed even based on advance marketing. And as if all the huge, concrete ideas behind the screenplay weren't enough, the story in and of itself is genuinely entertaining and compelling, let alone highly rewarding. The scene writing is marvelously strong, rich, and varied, keeping the proceedings fresh and engaging from start to finish; the dialogue and characters are as shrewdly penned as anything else in these two hours. What here is not brilliant, when all is said and done? Well, I gave my answer when I first sat down, but even if it's not flawless, the imperfections here are less about any discrete weaknesses or shortcomings and more about how stunningly busy the script is, stuffed to the proverbial gills and nearly straining to keep itself together even in the face of so much skill and wit. And if that's the worst that I can say about a picture, then I'd say it's done darn well for itself indeed.The promise of a star-studded cast, filled with persons I admire, and the involvement of an esteemed filmmaker and her partner, did nothing to quell skepticism when news first surfaced of a live-action Barbie movie on the big screen. The first teaser and subsequent trailer elicited much favor, but still I had my reservations, wondering above all how the same dazzling energy could possibly be sustained for a full-length feature. Then, to be frank, there came the swift, abrasive reactions from certain people - reactions that were laughably alarmist and apoplectic, not to mention outlandish and unreasonable. Suffice to say that such breath-taking reactions were the tipping point for me, as they elevated Greta Gerwig's 'Barbie,' from ""a film I might like to check out if I have the chance,"" to a must-see. And now that I have? While all my doubts have been erased and I could hardly be more pleased, I can also safely say that this is not the movie I was expecting. That riotous energy of the teaser and trailer isn't here for the whole runtime (though, most of it, certainly). What we get as complement and in its place, though, is masterful mindfulness and craftsmanship, and a jarring, somewhat backhanded, but very welcome and refreshing, wholehearted sincerity that is all the more smarter for the ways in which, sights unseen, it's kept hidden. Ironically, I ponder if this isn't too lofty in its writing, possibly going over the heads of those who might benefit most from what it has to offer. Even if that's true, though, this is so splendidly well done that it will hold up indefinitely, and be something to revisit time and again, both for those who want to see what we may have missed before, and to ensure that its message reaches the widest possible audience. When I was younger I'd never have thought a Barbie flick could be this good and substantive, but here we are: Gerwig's picture is well worth watching, and earns my very high, hearty recommendation.",Barbie
6.0,"Half an Hour too long, misses the point",GoatOfNeptune,22 July 2023,"Nolan is good at constructing complicated timing events. But he is not good at telling a biopic. The first half of the movie needs too long to built up, introduces too many charcters the are not important to the story ( heisenberg, Jean Tatlock). So he could have cut half an hour easily to speed things up.The second thing I was let down, is the focus of the story. The main struggle is not the building of the atomic bomb and the moral desaster that it killed over 200.000 people. The film clearly sticks to the argument, that without the bombs the japanese hadnt capitulated. There is only a minor dream scene where oppenheimer is stepping on the ashes of one single victim. Instead the main concern of the story is oppenheimers reputation, wether he had too close relationships to the communist party or not. So its just another film about the mccarthy era, and not the best. Good night and good luck told a better story about this era.So this is a navel show of the usa, of the witch hunt for communists after world war 2. But this is a distraction from the real important question wether the us-government became a monster itself while hunting a nazi monster. Until now there was no word of sorry for dropping two atomic bombs, not from obama, not from trump and not from biden when he visited hiroshima for the g7 in june.Nolans movie sticks strictly to the view of oppenheimer and the us military, never switching to the japanese view. It could have been so much more. A missed opportunity and nolans second worst movie after insomnia.",Oppenheimer
6.0,Watch it in 70MM if you dare !!!!,drneshom,25 July 2023,"I watched this movie on an IMAX theater in my hometown (Qatif); it's considered a 70MM cinema in our standards.. As everything was vividly pink, that particular experience made my eyes very sore!! Despite that, I can safely say that the Barbie film is somehow a funny ridiculous film and I would confidently recommend to watch it over watching Nolan masterpiece of garbage (oppenheimer).Is it boring? Mayyyybe but I don't think so.. does it need a 70MM IMAX? The answer is No No and No.. However, I strongly recommend to go and watch it in 70MM IMAX for the following reasons: the acting is acceptable; the plot is extremely silly; nudity and sex are alomst Zerrrro; you will witness different kinds of Barbie e.g. Skinny, overweight Barbie and more.. Simply put, it wins the Oscar for the most ridiculous movie of the year. So, stop the hate and go give it a genius try.",Barbie
8.0,Not a KIDS MOVIE PG13,teresa_wray,23 July 2023,About reality. None of the nonsense of ask the Barbie Movies. In all honesty it was about patriarchy and feelings being human. It was also about the relationship between children as they grow up and their toys. It would not be something i would expect to bring someone under the age of 13 to and expect them to be entertained. Very much more silly adult stuff than kids in the sense of being to understand.I told my human it was pretty much Rocky Horror Picture Show without the sexuality and way more pink. Not really a movie to take serious but lighthearted and just a goofy movie to enjoy on some down time. If it wasn't so new then i would do an Episode on my podcast about it.,Barbie
7.0,I'm a middle aged man with daughters. I liked it.,mr_sharma,27 July 2023,"I suspect this is a personal thing. Who you are defines what you may get from this.Me - I'm well into my mid life (had my crisis already thank you). I have daughters and both have watched this. I'm also pretty laid back to life. I encourage my children to be whatever the heck they wanna be and help them as much as I can.Now to the movie.For an afternoon showing, it was 2/3 full and mostly women and girls. Just an observation. But it was.The film is fun. It's tootles along with lots of off beat moments, a great monologue near the end (got teary there), silliness and self awareness (lots of self referential humour).My girls enjoyed it. I did too but not sure it's like 9/10 good. It's definitely enjoyable but 7/10 good.A Barbie movie could have been really bad. Really it could have been. But as has been shown by Lego movie, Detective Pickachu and few others....you can take something predominantly aimed at children and make it into something that both adults and children can engage with.The core message is great.I must say, I have heard a lot about Ryan Gosling being funny. He's ok. At least to me, he wasn't laugh out loud funny. There are much funnier things in this.But it is funny and enjoyable enough.Will Barbie dramatically change the landscape for dialogue? No, I don't think it will. It will though give pause for thought to all those who do go view it.A good, fun movie worth paying for the entertainment.",Barbie
10.0,FUTURE CLASSIC and EXTREMELY IMPORTANT MOVIE FOR THE PRESENT DAY,adrianbabech,19 July 2023,"Authentic audio-visual journey to the era of the birth of atomic genesis, which both terrifies and astonishes you with its nonlinear storytelling thanks to Christopher Nolan's masterful approach to direction and screenplay! The pacing of the movie is simply brilliant especially in the moments where the main theme by Ludwig Göransson kicks in! It's a future classic that will not leave you indifferent and will immerse you in the Homeric biography of the notorious scientist J. Robert Oppenheimer! Definitely a 10/10 for the artistic contribution to the history and art of audio-visual media depicting an extraordinarily important event for humanity and the present day!",Oppenheimer
8.0,"Marvellous and will win all the Oscars, but a challenging watch",namob-43673,21 July 2023,"As expected this is a fantastic movie. Oppenheimer contain some of the best acting ever seen and the directing is simply amazing. The music score is stunning, the story brilliantly told, and there are barely any flaws. This is intelligent filmmaking of the highest order and come Oscar season this will win all but a few of those statues.With that said I am still only giving this a 8/10 and I have two very good reasons for it.The first reason I think many will agree with me on and that is the length of the movie and the dragged out scenes, dragged out storytelling. This is one of the few rare cases were a studio executive should have put is fot down, but instead Nolan was likely given free range. The movie clocks in at 3 hours, and you do feel those hours because although this is one of most brilliant movies of our time, there is also almost nothing going on. There is talking, reading of paper, brief discussion about physics, more talking, reading more paper, another brief discussion. Only occasionally interrupted by a sex scene or a political discussion whether communism or fascism is the worst ideology. With the exception of the first atomic bomb explosion scene, which is beyond amazing, beyond brilliant, but except that scene what I mention above is the movie. That is it.Yes, the character study of Oppenheimer is in the center and as such this is one of the best ever made, but his career and life is portrait by reading of paper, a brief discussion about physics, more talking, reading more paper, another brief discussion. This is a movie you can watch one time for the novelty, twice for its brilliance, but after that never again because it will simply get boring.The second reason this movie is not perfect is the background- and side characters. Emily Blunt's acting is almost bad, or her character is badly written, perhaps both? And Florence Pugh? Seriously? The ""council"" gentlemen and the other students, and almost everyone not having a prominent role, are all so much worse than the main cast that it shows. Murphy, Matt and Robert are all fantastic and put in the performance of their lives and as long as the focus are on them, what they do, say etc. This might be the best movie ever made. But as soon as someone else come into the picture the quality immediately sink to almost mediocre level.With those negatives out of the way I need to mention the Atomic bomb explosion scene again. That scene is heart stopping, the entire movie theatre went so silent and the awe moment is absolute classic, stunning. Filmmaking at its best.A 8/10 and I highly recommend. If you can overlook the not so great actors, and you do not mind the dragged out runtime you are likely to think this is the best movie ever made. It is not, but it is the top contender of the year for sure. At least until The Marvels show up.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Incredible,avagodoy,23 July 2023,"Barbie was by far one of the best movies i've watched in 2023. From the acting to the costumes, it was all just so amazing. I have no words to express how i feel after watching Barbie. It had to much emotion built into it. Margot Robbie had such a speechless performance. Greta Grewig is the writer and director that can make a movie that has so much emotional value and meaning. It gives you a look into being a woman and the struggles but also about finding who you are as a person. I enjoyed this movie like no other it was hilarious and an emotional rollercoaster. I hope we can see a sequel to Barbie. The movie deserves all the love. Go watch it now!!!",Barbie
8.0,Worth watching,ArtsyBunny,21 July 2023,"Not a fan of the timing, i think the film was a bit long some scenes seemed unnecessary, the music and overall sound design was great though saved some scenes that were a bit long for certain, the framing of shots is a bit repetitive at times but the overall filming is as good as expected, the storytelling was great although a bit less clear near the end but it might just be an impression due to the length. Overall i think the movie was as good as expected, but might not be great if not viewed in a cinema, as it really needs good audio to help stay focused. Good not great, could be better, but still strongly recommend to see it.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Nolan Murphy professionalism,wwwjomusic,22 July 2023,"Hats off to Christopher Nolan. Murphy is living in thé character . No one can replace Murphy , really awesome. Nolan Murphy combination is extraordinary .Each and every scenes shows the professional movie shots. And some science theories is hard to understand in this movie especially the normal guys like me, except its all beautifully made. Its really good experience in IMAX digital. Not fully shot on IMAX but worth watching in IMAX. And for Indians I think its censored about 5-10mins. Must watch movie if you are a movie lover and experience it in IMAX for its fully immersive visual and sound experience.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Greta Gerwig Masterpiece,A7medSalah,19 July 2023,"A fun and clever enough comedy and twist on the world's most famous doll with wonderful production values, a charming Margot Robbie and an absolute hilarious Ryan Gosling.Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.Cinematography is great here, Set pieces are outstanding and the Soundtrack is a masterpiece.I want to take a minute to take about Greta Gerwig she is so clever and talented hope this movie will push her to direct big blockbuster movies that she deserves.",Barbie
6.0,Underwhelmed,rcowles0324,22 July 2023,"The acting and production values are up to Christopher Nolan's standards. Cillian Murphy was a great choice to play J. Robert Oppenheimer - that said, there were long stretches where his deadpan portrayal evoked little emotion (in me) regarding his complex character.If anyone stole the movie, it was Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss. RDJ moved seamlessly through the time shifts and was ultimately perfect as a foil to Oppenheimer. I won't get into any of the rest of the ensemble cast, but they all played their supporting roles quite well.So, why the six star review, then? Even at 3 hours, the film and character development felt incredibly rushed, and there were many aspects to this expansive story that weren't adequately fleshed out. To me, it would have been much more engaging as a 6 or 8 episode biopic mini-series. Oppenheimer didn't need to be IMAX film. The story was about his life's work and personal idiosyncrasies.At the end of the movie, I walked out of the theater to my car & never once said ""wow!"" While it was technically flawless, and was well cast, it never emotionally engaged me. YMMV.",Oppenheimer
8.0,"It's not what I expected, but I really appreciated it.",Ae_Sutthiphon,26 July 2023,"Even though I'm not all that attached to the story, the way the film portrays the complex emotions of the ""Father of the Atomic Bomb"" is fascinating. It gives audiences like us the freedom to interpret the identity of Oppy through the perspectives of him and the people around his life. Even though the film is mainly told from the Destroyer of Worlds's point of view, one can't help but think accordingly: in fact, What kind of person does he see himself as?This is the most different Nolan's flavor. Heavy politics, lots of dialogue, and a little bit of time-shifting narrative. It's a pity that I didn't have a chance to watch it in IMAX. Apart from the visuals, the sound in the normal theater is also not satisfying enough for me.I'm not that much into it, but still, this is one of the finest films of the year.",Oppenheimer
10.0,A Film for the big screen,adriano-40012,27 July 2023,"From the top tier cast to the cinematography this movie is a masterpiece. The source of historical events of Los Alamos, project Manhattan is recreated in fantastic detail. What I like the most is the fact it's no CGI. Absolute Boss production here with the IMAX camera x special effects. You don't wanna miss out on that movie. Color range with black & white expresses the objective perception and colorful the subjective perspective from Oppenheimer. I'm convinced that I probably missed even more hidden details.Cilian Murphy deserve this spot where he is right now. He's one of the best actors in the world. His best work ever. I can't single out every other actors work here the list wouldn't stop.The score of the movie was produced by Ludwig Göransson. He did an amazing job as usual in his previous work.There come scenes when you spot an actor you were not aware of being here and that's so awesome the way this movie mastered the difficulty of not wasting an actors skill set.Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors of all time. His way of making movies is unique.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Has issues but overall good movie,alexleroy-30178,22 July 2023,"Acting is good, Margot did an amazing job at portraying Barbie even though Ryan as Ken absolutely stole the show to be honest. Humour wasn't amazing but it was still good enough to make me laugh a few times. Plot is slightly messy, not horrible, like I get it but the movie didn't really dive into anything too deep either in my opinion but at least it does mention some important subjects. Another thing that bothered me was the waste of Will Ferrell's character who could have been a better ""villain"" that simply an incapable clown. I still very much enjoyed this movie and think the movie still works because it's execution, cool idea and good acting but needed a bit more complexity and maybe a better written villain with actual motives in order to become a ""masterpiece"".",Barbie
7.0,Spoiler-Free Unbiased Review,trevormdm,23 July 2023,"Barbie is a film that on the outside appeals to a younger audience but it is certainly much more mature in overall nature.Barbie pushes the boundaries of what a people blindly may assume a Barbie movie should or would be able to- in both good ways, and bad ways.The good- Barbie is at many moments, fun, adaptive, emotional, even philosophically provoking. The story is enjoyable and attention-grabbing while both Gosling and Robbie have played their roles to a T. Margot Robbie played the ""stereotypical Barbie"" so well, almost too well at times. Ryan Gosling played Ken so well and the contrast between him in two different arcs of the film were not only distinct but all-believable. The costume design was superb and I was thoroughly impressed with some of the visuals and set design throughout. The CGI is very poor at a few scenes (which normally I would put under cons) BUT the film doesn't take its self too seriously during those scenes, so it's rather comical than anything.The bad- The writing of this film contains certain elements of contradiction; It essentially claims that women can (mostly) only be powerful by holding ""high societal job responsibilities,"" such as being a lawyer, doctor, president, etc; when this just simply isn't true, MOTHERS FOR EXAMPLE! Being a mother is one of (if not the biggest) responsibility a human can have- the idea of a collective job that can single handedly shift an entire generations thinking? Yeah, sorry but mother's are the most powerful. The film at several moments gets very political but subliminally and not-subliminally, which is always annoying no matter what political beliefs you carry, it's just almost always cringe I guess?TLDR; ""Barbie"" triumphs in being fun, engaging, and thought-provoking. The film, like many others, sells itself short by its political agenda and removes depth by doing so. Overall a mostly enjoyable experience meant for an adult audience.7.3/10.",Barbie
7.0,"Amazing cast, two serious flaws",whitnall,23 July 2023,"The acting in this film is fascinating and the cast is absolutely stellar. It's an interesting story and certainly would have deserved a 9 were it not for two major flaws that are common in movies these days but taken to absurd excess here. First, the sound. It was so muffled and echoey, and the music and sound effects were so overwhelming, that my friends and I missed at least a third of the dialog. Since the drama depended on the dialog, this was a serious error in judgment. At times, it was obvious something very humorous was occurring in the dialog, but the entire audience just sat in confused silence trying to figure out what was going on. And then there were the frequent changes in scene. Just as you are settling into a scene, suddenly the story jumps to a different city, with different people, in a different decade. Between the inaudible dialog and the frenetic changes in scene, the film was often difficult to follow. I look forward to watching this with subtitles to see what I missed.",Oppenheimer
9.0,"Fine plot, good cast: yet too much sound/music effect",Serenus_Zeitblom,23 July 2023,"The plot is fine both for insiders who roughly know the story of Oppenheimer's and some physics as well for others who just might enjoy the drama(s) evolving in a fine visual way with strong dialogues.Oppenheimer's an independent mind, thus not fit for the ""normal"" world. But his academic brillance and courage gains him trust and support within his peers, so that this Jewish Lefty gets the task of organizing the atomic bomb for Roosevelt and the United States against Hitler, one of the first mega-projects in modern times ...Hence, we have a hero's journey here, especially as some ""normal"" people might try things (no details, sorry, you have to see for yourself).Recommendation? Yes, this movie does not feel180 min. The only sad thing that it relies on music and sound too heavily for that, a distraction and disturbance not appreciated by me in general.",Oppenheimer
10.0,"against the odds its a very good movie, not only for children",kincseaagnes,21 July 2023,"I went into the theatre thinking this is gonna be a little girls movie, about dolls and weird stuff. I thought it was gonna be a boring almost 2h movie about dolls, but oh boy was I wrong.not only was the theatre almost full on the third day of it airing, it was also: funny, inspiring, sad, and at times pretty confusing. It pretty much all felt like a fever dream, but in a good way. It also contained some jokes that were definitely for the adult/young-adult audience, but they were okay for teens like myself and the friend group i went with. Like, Barbie casually drops the word 'vagina' and Ken is talking about his genitals in a non-direct way, but the intention was still there. Some jokes landed pretty flat, but the big majority was very fun. Also the word 'patriarchy' was used way too many times by Ken (Ryan Gosling) and it felt almost annoying. The movie featured songs by the artists: Lizzo, Dua Lipa, Billie Eilish, Nicki Minaj and unfortunately Ice Spice. The soundtrack was absolutely incredible, maybe exept Ice Spice's song that was only heard at the credit roll, right at the end. We all know the movie was carried by the amazing Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, but I'd say Kate McKinnon's caracter and acting In conclusion this is a pretty good movie, and if you have the opportunity you should watch it.",Barbie
7.0,"Flawed, but a solid biopic nonetheless",brockfal,23 July 2023,"The story of J Robert Oppenheimer 'the father of the Atomic bomb' in the hands of Christopher Nolan is a somewhat over inflated dialogue heavy affair. The film flashes back and forwards in time, and is often engrossing, particularly during build up to the first A-Bomb test, but it also gets bogged down in the the political and scientific shenanigans both during and after WW2, which inhibits the narrative drive, at times to the point of becoming almost boring. I think a more economical approach could have made Oppenheimer truly gripping and great, and helped explore more effectively particularly the post WW2 period when Oppenheimer fell foul of McCarthy era investigations. I found the music score was often unnecessarily intrusive and annoying, further highlighting a sense of the film being just a bit over done, however, there is still much to savour, not the least an uncannily vivid and convincing performance by Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, and there are many other excellent performances too, and effectively the acting is the best thing about the film. In the end, I thought Oppenheimer was a largely coherent and informative portrait of the man, wonderfully performed, and meticulously written and directed by Nolan, but I thought it was just pretty good when just a bit more economy might have made it great.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Nolan is a true genius,alshaikhi,20 July 2023,"A movie that was undoubtedly amazing and undisputed. We did not feel bored throughout its three enjoyable hours, which was full of many scenes and details as if you were actually living that era in history. The movie was really the pinnacle of cinematic creativity, and is truly considered one of the rare cinematic icons, especially since it was made by the genius director Christopher Nolan, who writes his name in golden letters in history, And let's not forget the rest of the wonderful crew, without exception. I can say that the film deserves to compete for the Oscars this year, if not the best ever.",Oppenheimer
7.0,Bright Pink Fun,bo_w,27 July 2023,Barbie is basically exactly what we need right now. A hilarious summer blockbuster with a social commentary nuanced enough to allow young ones to enjoy but present enough for you to get something out of it. Margot Robbie is brilliant and a perfect Barbie. Gosling shows off his incredible comedic talent more than ever.Most all the jokes land well. It's clear that the actors understood Gerwig's vision and Gerwig and Baumbach's script. Set and costume design are on another level in Barbie. The distinction between Barbieland and the real world is done very well thanks to set design.See Barbie!,Barbie
10.0,Barbie a Must See,aruminger,21 July 2023,"This movie is AWESOME! Unexpected in so many good ways. Addresses so many social issues and complicated conversations in a fun, fair, and thoughtful way. What a joyful blend of comedy, music, color and memories from childhood. Every frame is filled with so much visual candy, and if you ever owned a Barbie or Ken or skipper or Alan you will not be disappointed by the costumes or sets. The actors, editing, directing, writing and set design are a solid 10. I don't think the previews do this movie justice, it was so much more than I expected. Mattel managed to pull this kaleidoscope of a movie off; kudos to the believers of this script. It is so worth seeing once, twice, three times and then some!",Barbie
9.0,A Thought-Provoking Glimpse into History and Humanity's Ethical Dilemma,jonathanantoniothomas,21 July 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" is not simply a tale of the most prominentt physicist during World War II; it is a portrayal of America's past, present, and future. Skillfully illustrating the ideological divisions between the left (communists) and the right (loyal Americans), the movie reminds us that history not only recounts the past but also explains our present.Christopher Nolan once again demonstrates his prowess in filmmaking, proving that quality cinema thrives in 2023.The film weaves together two narratives. Firstly, it delves into how humanity attained its tremendous power. Secondly, it examines the consequential aftermath of wielding such power.Cillian Murphy delivers an outstanding performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, potentially defining his legacy as an actor. Oppenheimer is portrayed as a complex man, flawed like any ordinary mortal, yet gifted with a profound understanding of the quantum world. This brilliance is visually depicted on screen with impressive execution.The movie also unveils Oppenheimer's political struggle, torn between his communist sympathies and the need to protect his fellow Jews from annihilation.Robert Downey Jr.'s performance as Lewis Strauss is equally praiseworthy, dispelling any doubts about his ability to move beyond the iconic Iron Man role. Though his screen time is brief, Downey Jr.'s impact is undeniable.The sound design plays a significant role, becoming almost a cast member, effortlessly guiding the audience through various emotions and settings. The accompanying score complements the sound seamlessly.Every actor and actress involved in the film possess impressive resumes, reflecting Nolan's esteemed reputation in the industry. The performances are all top-notch and reflect the director's respect for the craft.""Oppenheimer"" pushes the audience to question our morality and our ego. It ignites discussions about the consequences of humanity's tendency to exploit scientific advancements to the detriment of others, rather than seeking collective benefits.However, it's important to note that the movie might disappoint those anticipating a fast-paced story about the bomb. While the backdrop is Trinity and the A-Bomb, the film primarily revolves around thoughtful dialogue and a cerebral narrative as it pertains to the work and accomplishments of Robert Oppenheimer.Emotional resonance takes a backseat to intellectual engagement, which may not hit home with every moviegoer. Nevertheless, this focus on biography and thoughtful exploration serves the film's purpose.Technically, the movie excels in every aspect, earning it the status of a phenomenal creation. Yet, it falls short of reaching its full potential, as the writing leans heavily towards the biographical elements, rather than the imaginative aspects that elevate such films.Assigning a definite rating feels premature; repeated viewings might influence one's perspective. As a preliminary review, I would rate it 8.8/10 for now, with the possibility of revision in the future.Ultimately, ""Oppenheimer"" presents an enriching cinematic experience that warrants a visit to the IMAX theatre for anyone intrigued by the topic. It encourages introspection and instigates discussions, making it a movie that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll.",Oppenheimer
5.0,Bait-and-Switch Barbie,mib918,25 July 2023,"Summary: This isn't the fun, light-hearted fantasy the marketing would have you believe. It is instead a clunky film that is nearly all social commentary. In fact, the plot and protagonist of the film is the patriarchy and more specifically men. The result is a sexist film that can be good at times but frustrating for many viewers. The movie may even be damaging to woman (explanation below).Full Review:I will justify my summary above but I want to first share that the film has a tremendous amount of potential and that I will be looking forward to a sequel should it come out. The cast is excellent. Gosling absolutely steals the show and is clearly having a ton of fun. Robbie is also a gem and is the quintessential Barbie. They could not have picked a better cast. The set design was fun and probably exactly what you would hope for in a Barbie film. The tempo was great, the cameos were fun, the movie was appropriately self-aware, the humor generally landed well. It's probably not a kids movie and I think that I wouldn't want my kids to attend it do to the adult humor and the social commentary bit. I think that for the right audiences the social commentary might elicit some good discussions and may be interesting to some.I don't mind social commentary but I'd prefer to know that its in the film before I go. If I do go see a movie with social commentary its not generally as clunky as the movie Barbie is. For example, after the movie I asked several people what they thought was the message of the movie and no one person had the same answer. Surely the message centers around feminism or woman's empowerment. These are themes that generally everyone can get behind but the movie isn't clear on specifics. Does the movie intend to convey that Barbie is problematic as a doll or symbol? Is the movie suggesting the patriarchy is a problem? Is it that woman can do anything they put their mind to it? Is it saying the diversity is important? Basically... the movie fails to pinpoint what exactly it is trying to comment on.Generally if you go see a movie that is intended to be social commentary then you should come out of it with thought provoking questions and ideas. It should be a movie that ""flips the script"" so that if you are on the opposite side of an issue you become more aware/informed after watching the movie. Unfortunately Barbie doesn't do this. Barbie lives in a fantasy world but the real world n the film is also a fantasy. She doesn't face any real world or realistic dilemma causing us to evaluate the gender systems we have in place. Even the times Barbie is subjected to discrimination or sexism (which is fairly constant) these times are not realistic or believable. Thus the commentary comes off as preachy and anecdotal.Barbie is also not a role model or a hero in the movie. It's weird watching a movie that is written to empower woman while also featuring a weak and sexist female lead. The film begins with Barbie dismissing men and being biased towards woman. I don't want to leave any spoilers but.... SEMI-SPOILER... the movie ends with things being unequal between the sexes. As a result the film almost suggests that the sexes shouldn't be treated equally. In other words, its clear Barbie and Barbie the movie believes females are the superior gender.Moreover, Barbie is not a strong and powerful woman. We are told in the movie that Barbie is an inspiration to woman fairly constantly. Normally I would agree. But the Barbie in this movie is depicted as uncapable and weak. She is egocentric and motivated by a desire to be beautiful. In fact, the entire plot kicks off because she finds cellulite on her legs and it later revolves around her self-centered interests to maintain power in her community. Its hard to relate or feel sympathetic under these circumstances and if anything the plot is an indictment on woman's (and societies) overuse of beauty and sexuality. As Barbie trots along her path she doesn't overcome anything on her own and she doesn't change as a person. In fact, everything she ""accomplishes"" is because someone told her what to do or because someone else did something for her. Not one time can I recall did Barbie accomplish something on her own or reevaluate her positions. By the end of the movie she is still the same problematic Barbie we were first introduced to. This is an interesting problem because it means that Ken, the movie's antagonist is actually the hero of the film. He is the only one in the film that overcomes adversity and is the only one in the film who grows and changes. We don't root for Ken, of course, but if you spend a few minutes thinking about his character arch you will realize he is actually the victim and the hero of the movie. This is what I meant by saying it is a clunky film - it has too many mixed messages, unexplored and unrealistic themes, and watered down but constant social commentary. Then add the fact that the social commentary expressed in the film is of a serious issue but is juxtaposed with a lighthearted comedic tone.Then there is the problem with the movie's portrayal of men and specifically Ken. First, lets acknowledge how woman have been poorly portrayed in past by depicting them as weak and needing men. We can agree its inappropriate - so its confusing as to why the film does the same thing, except to men. Ken is portrayed as inferior to Barbie in every way when the appropriate thing to do would be highlight the strengths in both genders. A counter argument people may make is, ""Dude, its just a movie about a doll and its a fantasy land."" I get it, its not real. But the problem is the movie depicts men as inferior and stupid in both the fantasy and real world. In fact, there is little distinction between the men in both worlds. On the other hand, the woman in the real world are depicted more genuinely and certainly more intelligently. This leads me to conclude that the writers likely do have a problem with men even if they were trying to be humorous. In fact, there is a whole subplot with an all male corporate board that seems to be a non-sequitur. It seems its only purpose in the film was to dump on men or, in the alternative, the whole subplot was intended to be something intelligent but ended up being too poorly conceived to be meaningful in any way.So, I have to say the film is disappointing and problematic in so many ways. But the potential is huge. I would look forward to a sequel but they have to drop the social commentary or, in the alternative, make a more cohesive movie with less mixed signals. Barbie should demonstrate why she is so amazing and earn her place at the top. We don't see why she is special or see her become the hero in her own movie. I expected to see a movie about a powerful woman who also likes to have fun. What I got instead was a bait and switch.",Barbie
6.0,"Beautiful film, but so preachy",LoveofLegacy,21 July 2023,"Margot does the best with what she's given, but this film was very disappointing to me. It was marketed as a fun, quirky satire with homages to other movies. It started that way, but ended with over-dramatized speeches and an ending that clearly tried to make the audience feel something, but left everyone just feeling confused. And before you say I'm a crotchety old man, I'm a woman in my 20s, so I'm pretty sure I'm this movie's target audience. The saddest part is there were parents with their kids in the theater that were victims of the poor marketing, because this is not a kid's movie. Overall, the humor was fun on occasion and the film is beautiful to look at, but the whole concept falls apart in the second half of the film and becomes a pity party for the ""strong"" woman.",Barbie
10.0,Barbie existentialism.,jp_91,24 July 2023,"Barbie, the doll that destroyed stereotypes and taboos to later generate new ones and destroy them again, arrives at the cinema for the first time and does so masterfully. ""Barbie"" is a film that portrays misogyny from the perspective of the famous doll, the script is a biting criticism of patriarchy, internal problems within feminism, family and social relationships, consumerism and existentialism, all full of humor, in some scenes with a lot of black humor and the result is excellent, capturing what it wants to convey to the public. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is magnificent and together with the production design they bring a fictional country full of fantastic and pink plastics. The soundtrack is tremendous, with a list of songs wisely chosen (with some exceptions). The cast is tremendous, Margot Robbie's performance is realistic and sentimental, proving to be the perfect Barbie in all aspects. Ryan Gosling plays Ken with humor and also gives him perfect dramatic nuances. America Ferrara as a working mother achieves a performance to remember, especially for her powerful monologue. Kate McKinnon gives a highly comic performance and an endearing character of a very unusual Barbie. Rhea Perlman pulls off an incredible performance wittily balancing comedy and drama. Ann Roth in a special participation of a single dialogue and a smile achieved a sublime and unforgettable performance. Helen Mirren with a voice acting as The Narrator describes everything with feeling and passion taking advantage of her imposing voice. Greta Gerwig's work as a director is genius, she manages to capture the ideas of the script, gives it her own style and pays homage to movie classics. ""Barbie"" is the movie event of the year, a rightfully earned title for this current classic.",Barbie
10.0,Best Communal Cinema Experience Since Endgame,lstuart_berry,22 July 2023,I was all in for this movie before I saw it. As time went by I got concerned my expectations were impossibly high and I'd inevitably be disappointed. Saw it opening night in a packed cinema all dressed in pink (yes the men too). I laughed far more than I expected and had a damn good cry. My ridiculous expectations were exceeded.Barbie is funnier and more touching than I was expecting. It's just the right kind of meta and deals with gender roles and our complicated feelings about Barbie and what she represents in a balanced and realistic way. I'm not sure how I left a film after staring at Margo Robbie and the rest and felt better about myself than before I went in. See it in the cinema if you can. Going from a loudly giggling crowd to suddenly being able to hear a pin drop when the film hit some hard truths was wonderful. Fill two hours of your time with joy and Kenergy! We are all Kenough.,Barbie
9.0,I hated Barbie. Now there is the film poster in my room.,JonnaGranger,21 July 2023,"I have never been a fan of Barbie: I found her too pink, too clichéd - until I watched this film. As the trailer suggested, this movie is for people who hate the legendary doll, so I gave it a shot. It was worth it: I seldom had that much fun in cinema.Barbie lives her happy life in Barbieland, but as she develops a human consciousness, she has to travel to the real world in order to restore normality.This movie is so much more than just funny, as it is political and not predictable. It discusses the influence of the doll on young girls: It criticizes Barbie's stereotypical body while acknowledging her for revolutionizing the way girls saw themselves.""Because Barbie can be anything, girls can be anything"" is said throughout the film. As Barbie taught girls to be more than just mothers, this is true.Margot Robbie has proved what a great actress she is. That makes her the perfect cast for Barbie, as you take her seriously and sympathize with her. Ryan Gosling as her counterpart is equally fitting. He provides the film with a great sense of humor that will leave you laughing out loud.All in all, ""Barbie"" differs from the majority of movies that are produced in Hollywood right now, as it is refreshingly new, funny and surprising. Director and author Greta Gerwig has done a great job creating this hilarious summer movie.",Barbie
6.0,A Hot Pink Mess,aherdofbeautifulwildponies,26 July 2023,"Before making Barbie (2023), Greta Gerwig single-handedly directed two films: Lady Bird (2017) and Little Women (2019). Both were about girls on the precipice of adolescence, both had nuanced and layered portrayals of mother-daughter relationships, both combined imaginative visuals with clever dialogue. Both were very, very good. Given those credentials, one may expect Barbie to be as intelligent, convincing and amusing a picture - and, well, it isn't.The fantasy comedy begins in Barbie Land, a place where Barbie (played by Margot Robbie) is having the best day every day, in the company of other Barbies and, occasionally, Kens. The designs, costumes, and cinematography do an excellent job re-creating the Mattel vision in its pink plastic perfection. The introduction is referential but not overtly reliant on what is external to the film; it is smartly self-aware and presents a world where Barbie can be anything - a President, a Physicist, a Journalist, a Lawyer, or a Mermaid. Much like with the original toys, Ken () comes as an afterthought and 'only exists within the warmth of Barbie's gaze'.The plot is set in motion when Barbie begins having thoughts about death and, normally suspended in the state of standing on the balls of her feet, she feels her heels hit the ground. What follows is journey in reverse (the parallel is explicit) and, ultimately, a Pinocchio storyline of the doll in the Real World.If Barbie was fully dedicated to that conceit - as promised by the trailer - it could be an interesting exploration in the way of or . Instead, the film chooses to introduce a handful of conflicts, threats, and plot-lines that are never fully realised. What is the nature of the connection between a Barbie and the girl who plays with the doll in the Real World? What would happen if Barbie were put back in the box? Why is Gloria (), the receptionist at the Mattel headquarters and, later, Barbie's Real-World companion, depressed - and how is that eventually resolved? Why is Gloria's daughter Sasha () cross with her mother? Why does the board of Mattel spend one third of the film hiding in the bushes? Most importantly, the crux of the third-act conflict - set in Barbie Land now renamed 'Kendom' - contradicts what had been previously established about that world and its inhabitants.Towards the finale, the production evolves into explicit commentary on gender roles. One side is presented as clueless and attention-seeking, while the other is manipulative and vengeful. The film repeatedly takes offence with 'mansplaining', yet behaves in a blithely patronising manner towards the viewer. Much of what is declared is not supported by what has been shown, and the picture relies on the presumed prior experience of the audience, rather than on storytelling. While the denouement includes one of the film's highlights, the musical number 'I'm Just Ken', the ending does not resolve (or acknowledge) much, and the final scene is reductive to the point of being offensive.Barbie is very easy on the eye, and the acting ranges from competent to inspired, with praiseworthy performances by the leading actors. Margot Robbie is pitch-perfect as Barbie, and Ryan Gosling shines as her counterpart, often stealing the show. Situational comedy and slapstick mostly land, while some of the bon mots are funny, yet hardly plausible when spoken by the characters.If only this were better written. If only the joyride in the pink convertible did not leave you with blond hair in your mouth.",Barbie
4.0,"Tackles too much, ironic shadow of feminism",kimryanrr,23 July 2023,"The sets/costumes are the best part, and Ken (Ryan Gosling) delivers some memorable laughs and the most interesting character. The plot tried to take on too many themes it can't fully address and ends up feeling shallow. Themes include mortality, patriarchy, capitalism, feminism, self worth, brainwashing, motherhood, relationships, stereotypes and on and on.Also, so many inconsistencies/loose ends. The Barbie's are sometimes robotic perfection and sometimes self actualized feminists. What happened to Skipper? Why did Barbie's human connection fall off the script once she meets Gloria (the human)? Does the dim witted male board act like nothing happened after all this? Also, the characters are very under utilized, I kept waiting for Alan to do something and Gloria felt so flat and predictable (and Will Ferrell's CEO and board is written as a shallow SNL skit that does not make the human world feel real at all, which cheapens Gloria's ""real"" female story). It really was all over the place, but did have some creative moments.Besides the irony of Ken standing out in a film against the patriarchy, it's hilarious that the main irony is Mattel absolutely winning a lucrative advertising campaign in a film against greedy capitalism! In the movie the male Mattel board is a ridiculous, money hungry machine, but in reality, the female makers of this film will profit millions alongside Mattel (ie- benefit from capitalism), and Mattel has many females on their real life board. I wish the film showed those females and how much women actually have accomplished in the real world and what we have overcome.",Barbie
10.0,Not just a movie,harrypotter-01317,24 July 2023,"This movie is insane! It has everything and Nolan is able to pace it so well, all the tension during dialogue, movie of the century. Not to mention all the great actors and actresses, wow Cillian Murphy was phenomenal, his eyes could talk, Emily Blunt nailed it with the so called non trial scene, Matt Damon was very subtle but his acting was so deep and solid, last but not least, RDJ was so great, we all know he's great but he was under the ironman shadow, he shook it off so damn well.To summarize, Oppenheimer is not just a movie, it's literally ART, I would say it's my favorite Nolan movie, it's slow when it needed to, it's fast when it needed to. The atmosphere and the pace is PERFECT. Definitely a must-see movie, I stopped drinking and eating three hours before watching Oppenheimer, and it's worth every bit of my efforts, it lives up to the hype.",Oppenheimer
10.0,screaming crying throwing up,beezbog,23 July 2023,"This movie is not only an actually funny comedy with an amazing script and good jokes, but a seriously intense story of womanhood, girlhood and motherhood that portrayed how much the patriarchy affects everyone. As a girl, this movie resonated with me and every single line about being a girl in this world hit me hard, but it was so beautiful. I've seen men say that this movie was 'feminist garbage' or 'over-exaggerated' but it honest to god wasn't. Not only this, but while being a movie that accurately represents the feeling of not knowing who you are or what you are going to be (aka girlhood) it was pro-men and not in a bad way. Somehow, a movie so strongly empowering women also gave men feeling and hurt. This made the movie so honest and just good. I could go on for hours about how much this movie means to me, and that it's something with messages that will stick with me forever.With all this being said, it was funny as hell and my whole theater was dying at some of the jokes made 😭 they did not hold back.",Barbie
9.0,easily movie of the year,mandana-a,23 July 2023,"Very good movie but can understand it being draining and too long for some people to the point that it gets boring and you fall out.Of course you'll get very good acting, depend on classical dark nolan style and beautiful cinematic.A part of history that is so important and revolutionary done perfectly imo.I enjoyed the long stretches and dialogues to really get the sense and feel everything through J. Robert Oppenheimer.It's like the more you see and observe the more you understand everything about the movie.You really have to be turned on and tuned to watch it if you want to get something from this movie. I am sure you'll like it if you want to end up with that.",Oppenheimer
10.0,It's beautiful.,zoooooe,25 July 2023,"This one reminds me of why I love movies so much. Acting, dancing, visual arts, screenplay, plots, soundtracks, humor, moral, there are everything we need in a movie. What hit me the most is that I was only expecting the kind of adult humor in that Barbie song ""You can brush my hair undress me everywhere,"" but at some point I realize it's way more than that. The movie was hilarious that I remember my mouth was opened laughing the whole time you know, all the Barbie jokes. And it's so cute that just right at the beginning of the movie, I instantly fell back to my childhood memories and everything is pink it's so beautiful. Yet, it's such a deep movie that it told things we almost be numb to. It said it out loud to remind us who we are and what are our worth and where are we going and everything. It's a movie about love. I cried so hard and laughed so hard. It's a masterpiece.",Barbie
7.0,"Barbie: Not For Me, But It's Fine For What It Is",CutlasSaber,23 July 2023,"This probably wouldn't come off as a shocker to anyone who knows me, but I'm definitely not the target audience for this film. That doesn't mean I dislike the film in anyway, just thought that would be an important thing to point out before actually reviewing this film.Surprisingly the movie wasn't generic or filled with over-the-top cliches, and judging from the trailer, I thought I'd have seen this story play out so many times before. I mainly expected it to depend on its humor, which is probably the only thing that lived up to my expectations because I'm a way it kind of did. It actually had a compelling message that had decent pacing to lead up to that message (obviously the message wasn't directed towards me in any way, but to young girls who struggle with these issues, that's not to say the message is bad or anything, I just can't say much about a message that's not even directed towards me).Without Ryan Gosling, I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this film as much as I did. I'm definitely not saying the other actors were completely horrible in there role, because it's quite the opposite, I just don't think it would've lived up to Gosling's performance to me. I like Margot Robbie as an actress, and I think she does a great job for this role. And for the most part a lot of the actors here were great too of course.If I had to come up with one negative for this film, maybe the gender roles thing was a little preachy, but honestly it doesn't bother me nearly as much as most films handle this subject. I've seen how completely woke certain films can be, and it's not nearly as bad as the way this film handles it so I can't really be too upset about it. Other than that, this is a film you can't really take seriously because it's a comedy. All I can say is this movie was fine, but definitely not for me, and that's ok.",Barbie
7.0,Barbie - A Comedy Film with Something to Say,Picturesinflow,28 July 2023,"Barbie is a film that revolves around fun and enjoyment. The story centers on our titular character, Barbie, in her world full of pink, numerous other Barbies and Kens, unique rules, and a repetitive daily routine. The movie overflows with laughter, clever remarks, musical numbers, dazzling sets, existential crises, and much more.Margot Robbie, portraying Barbie, and Ryan Gosling, playing Ken, thoroughly embodied their roles to the fullest. As the main character in her world, Barbie is admired by everyone and sought after for attention. She must adhere to the ""Stereotypical Barbie"" image with flawless perfection, which can become exhausting over time. On the other hand, Ken serves as the placeholder character for the public, and with his dry humor, he delivers the majority of laughs throughout the film, showcasing his unwavering adoration for Barbie.Director Greta Gerwig, known for her unique storytelling, showcases her creativity once again in Barbie. The dialogue is woven in a way that allows for multiple interpretations, enabling Barbie to discuss her own world and even extend beyond it. The movie transcends the boundaries of a typical comedy at times and addresses issues that resonate in our own world.The bold choice of including a reference to '2001: A Space Odyssey' before the actual start sets an enthralling mood. The film initially feels like an episode from the Twilight Zone, with the repeating day trope, but gradually reveals something amiss. These daring choices elevate Barbie from being just another comedy movie to a film with a deliberate vision.Barbie slightly teeters on the edge of delivering patriarchal messages, especially towards the end, but it manages to steer clear of crossing the line. As one of the original feminist icons since her creation in 1959, certain types of comments were inevitable. The movie addresses these issues with eloquence, all while remembering its primary purpose is to entertain and offer an escape to a fictional world.The marketing strategy for Barbie is nothing short of brilliant. Pairing it with Oppenheimer, a drastically different film, for a double feature is a stroke of genius. Viewers have the choice to immerse themselves first in the bubbly and joyful world of Barbie, followed by the thought-provoking story of Oppenheimer. The success of this marketing approach is evident in the box office results, as many attendees opted for both screenings, turning it into a global film festival with two back-to-back films.The production design, as showcased in the dazzling trailers, is impeccable, packed with intricate details, easter eggs, various era Barbies and Kens, and more. The commitment put into curating these elements from different years and presenting them in an engaging manner is commendable.Barbie arrives at an interesting time, with both writers and actors on strike, and Hollywood on the verge of temporary closure. However, the combination of Barbie and Oppenheimer offers audiences a choice and a break from the usual superhero or unnecessary sequel movies. Barbie delivers abundant laughter, lively music, outstanding performances, and takes viewers on an immensely enjoyable journey.",Barbie
1.0,Such a bad movie,fgarrido-98202,19 July 2023,"I was expecting so much maybe.The only thing I like is when Ruth appears and we felt the connection mother daughter and when we used to play together.The cast was good but the movie so randomly weird, non sense, nothing you would expect from such a cool director.Visuals ok, but come on, it is such a waste of time and money.The argument gets totally lost, there is no line to follow up.Without Gosling or Robbie this movie would be one of the worst in history.Pretty interesting you can see all the barbie types, all the Ken too but to be honest, in our times we need more content. This movie only reminded me why is so hard to be a woman and perfection expected.",Barbie
1.0,If you're a Nolan fan. don't watch this movie.,ggqcktkbd,25 July 2023,I was so excited to watch this movie. My dream shattered and it's one of the most boring movie. First flop of Christopher Nolan.I won't trust the ratings anymore. It's just a scam I think. There was nothing in the movie...please save your time and money. Don't watch this movie. I am Nolan fan but it doesn't mean that I am going to like a messed up movie. After watching for over two hours. I decided sleep is better than watching this movie.1 star only for music.. they were just babbling in the whole movie. It's awful experience and I wasted my night. I am writing the review to save time and money of the people.,Oppenheimer

It addresses delicate and fragile topics with precision. It was surprising and totally unexpected. Admittedly, the first half an hour is hard to get through, but you really get into it once you get the idea and you're totally consumed in it and already questioning yourself and the society before you realise. However, they could have concluded it better by finding a middle ground or presenting a solution to the problems addressed. Nevertheless, its overall impact makes it a must-see for everyone.",Barbie
7.0,Not a 10,JoeyCeee,22 July 2023,"Solid 7.5. Great acting, great visuals, so-so editing. Nice to see Ciliian Murphy getting a leading role. No actor is better at acting w/o saying anything. It's the semi-watering eyes. I'll have to look into all the non-bomb making aspects of his life, I know so little. Didn't know about the commie ties, the losing security clearance (whatever), and all the rest. Ni ce to so many actors having 1-2 lines and doing a great job, I guess they all wanted to be in it.

3.0,Extremely disappointed,gatvideosmkii,22 July 2023,"I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting much from Barbie, but this was bad. An awful plot with some very unnecessary sequences, and it feels far too preachy to be an enjoyable movie. There is a good movie in there somewhere, but it is buried underneath unnecessary characters and preachy dialogue. I personally would not recommend watching this in theaters, if I hadn't been watching it with my friends (so that we could joke about how bad it was) I would have felt that I had wasted 2 hours of my life. Of course, maybe this movie just isn't my cup of tea. Other than the poor plot, I thought that the acting was done reasonably well, about what you would expect with the cast of the movie, and there were a few funny moments sprinkled in there as well.",Barbie
5.0,mixed bag,sjo-15,24 July 2023,"I found this to be a mixed bag.First up, when I walked into the cinema I expected there to be lots of young Barbie fans - there weren't more than a handful. The audience was a real cross section. Probably the majority were females - just. People of all ages from a few young girls through to pensioners - with lots in the teeneager to late 20's group. Lots of people wearing pink.This is the first time I can remember since Terminator 2 where I couldn't go to the screening time I wanted as it was sold out for my two first choices (in the day time).I was expecting a high camp movie that works on both levels - young kids and something for the adults. Thats not really what we got. This is not a kids movie. The group of kids sat near us were visibly bored after the first half an hour. Its a 12A for a reason. There seems to be a perception that this movie is for little girls waving Barbies around - it isn't.The first half hour has all the camp stuff, setting the scene, adults acting as dolls, funny Barbie world-isms, etc.Then it changes when America Ferrera and her joy-sucking teenage daughter are introduced. It stops being so much fun. The central message of the film is then clumsily hammered home with no subtlety for the rest of the movie - taking the viewer out of Barbie world. Its message is also delivered inconsistently.The final joke of the movie does not hit home very well and seemed a bit unnecessary.With the above criticisms, heres the mixed bag bit - it was very funny in places. We laughed out loud lots, but seemed to be the only people in the 3/4 full theatre laughing. Its also very clever in places - like the discontinued Barbies.Ryan Gosling is excellent. Will Ferrell is hilarious. Michael Cera is good. Others are confusing (Rhea Perlman's character...). I expected more from Ncuti Gatwa - given he is the new Dr Who.Some very amusing musical numbers.It felt a little long. Would have made a nice 90 minute movie.",Barbie
10.0,Masterpiece,barikooo,23 July 2023,"Oppenheimer is an absolute triumph in the world of cinema, leaving a lasting impression with its powerful storytelling and exceptional performances. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer is nothing short of mesmerizing. He flawlessly captures the physicist's brilliance, inner conflicts, and transformation throughout the film. Robert Downey Jr., in a supporting role, delivers a compelling performance, showcasing his versatility as an actor.The film's musical score, composed by a maestro, complements the narrative beautifully. It weaves a tapestry of emotions, heightening the tension and drama of pivotal moments. The music becomes an integral part of the movie, guiding viewers through Oppenheimer's journey and adding layers of depth to the storytelling.Overall, Oppenheimer is a tour de force, tackling complex themes of ambition, ethics, and the human cost of scientific progress. The direction is masterful, deftly balancing the scientific discoveries with the personal struggles of its characters. The film's narrative arc keeps viewers engaged from start to finish, evoking a wide range of emotions.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Surprisingly Great!,tfpdbbxck,25 July 2023,"I went into this film opening day for a good laugh not expecting too much from it. When I exited the theatre I was shocked by how good of a film it was. I didn't expect it to be so funny, so we'll written, I just thought it would be okay and a bit cheesy but no. Truly a great film but there are a few jokes that might go over young kids heads, as well as some of the references. One of the most fun films of the year to experience, especially if you are depressed after watching 'Oppenheimer'. It has moments of sadness, laughs and so much more.

8.0,"Short, but simple.",hashimotoju,23 July 2023,"I will say I was waiting a long time for this to finally hit theaters and I was not dissappointed. Let's start with the slight negatives I have about this movie. The story seemed to drag a little bit, on top of it being 3 hours long. It is really slow paced, slower than I would of liked. The good thing I would say is that the story itself is very intriguing and grasping. That is what made it better.The second thing I would say is that there was too much time spent on the drama portion rather than actually seeing everyone come together to accomplish the goal. There was very little screen time showing how everyone worked together and even missing just a few small things about how they came up with all the equations for Fission/Fusion. For example.Those are my minor personal gripes with the movie. On the other hand, the acting, plot, and everything else was accurate and entertaining to watch. Oppenheimer is the best movie I've seen in the past 2 years. This isn't a movie I would watch every year, but I would definitely watch plenty of times over my lifetime. I would give it a soft 8.5/10 and a solid 8.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Extraordinary,radders_007,20 July 2023,"Title: A Critical Review: Christopher Nolan's ""Oppenheimer""In ""Oppenheimer,"" Christopher Nolan plunges into the labyrinth of the Manhattan Project, depicting the life and internal conflict of Robert Oppenheimer, the man at the epicenter of it all. Nolan, known for his sophisticated narratives, delivers yet another stirring and profound masterpiece.Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is at the heart of the film. Murphy captures the multifaceted persona of Oppenheimer with profound authenticity, manifesting the physicist's intellectual brilliance and the moral torment that ensued from his involvement in the creation of the atomic bomb. His depiction of Oppenheimer is a masterstroke in acting, brilliantly portraying a man on the razor's edge of scientific discovery and human destruction.Emily Blunt as Katherine, Oppenheimer's wife, offers a moving performance. Her depiction of a woman wrestling with the moral implications of her husband's work is deeply touching. Blunt's nuanced portrayal provides an affecting counterpoint to Murphy's tormented Oppenheimer, forming an emotionally resonant narrative core.Robert Downey Jr., in his most profound role since ""Chaplin,"" plays Lewis Strauss, the stern figurehead of the Atomic Energy Commission. Abandoning his typically charismatic persona, Downey Jr. Brings an intensity and seriousness that is riveting. His performance offers a stark look at the determination of the U. S. administration during the atomic age. His role as Strauss adds a layer of authority and command to the narrative, effectively embodying the bureaucratic pressure that fueled the Manhattan Project.Nolan's directorial prowess shines throughout, masterfully weaving together the personal turmoil of Oppenheimer with the wider socio-political climate of the era. The pacing is expertly managed, building tension incrementally before culminating in a classic Nolan climax.""Oppenheimer"" excels in historical representation. The production design, costumes, and cinematography blend together to create an immersive 1940s world. Shot for IMAX, the movie provides a truly authentic and captivating experience.However, the film's complex narrative structure could be a point of critique. At times, the story can feel a little convoluted, and certain plotlines may get obscured. Despite this minor shortcoming, the film's central themes and emotional impact remain strong and potent.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" stands as a deeply moving examination of one of history's most controversial figures. The compelling performances by Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, and an unexpectedly serious Robert Downey Jr. Offer a rich and diverse portrayal of characters. Though the narrative complexity might pose challenges for some viewers, Nolan's deft directorial hand ensures a captivating and reflective cinematic experience. ""Oppenheimer"" serves as a stark reminder of the weighty moral responsibilities accompanying scientific advancement, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll.",Oppenheimer
6.0,Good but not that good.,ilikelickingeyeballs,23 July 2023,"The colors, shots, houses, clothes were really amazingly done. Margot and Rayan were amazing, beautiful and acted well. I will say that. I find that the movie wasn't THAT good. The story wasn't as entertaining as it could. This was supposed to be like a childrens show with adult humor and topics but I didnt find most of the jokes funny, i felt like they were just screaming stuff in your face instead of being more subtle. I wish some aspects of the characters and side stories were explored more. The ending was okay but i wished for something diffrent and again more about the side characters. Ken is a cool character i gotta say. He deserves the world and to really find something more about him. So i wouldn't say it was a bad movie, its okay to watch more casually, more so to appreciate the dolls and the nostalgia. I was lowkey dissapointment with all the hype i gotta say.Ps. I find it weird that this is considered such a ""woke"" movie but did not mention that boys can play with dolls ONCE. Like cmon I had a Barbie too!",Barbie
3.0,NOT family friendly,eRobb4,21 July 2023,"This movie is made for adults, not suitable for children. Despite its marketing campaign that could easily be mistaken for a fun, kid-friendly film, it is riddled throughout with adult language, sexuality, and mature themes. It's a surprisingly unrelenting work of misandry, toxic relationships, and alternative lifestyles coated in the pink plastic shell of a beloved toy. At times it's hard to determine whether the message of the film is more about depression, disappointment, or death as the reality of the human condition. It's a clumsy attempt to paint people groups with a broad brush in order to win sympathy points for the main characters.The production was great, though. The music was stirring and heartfelt, and the visual presentation of the film was unique and enjoyable. The actors also brought movingly authentic performances. And there were some clever comedic moments that brought at least some relief to the suffocatingly heavy-handed onslaught of toxic messaging. It could've been a great movie.",Barbie

7.0,Well played.,PK_71,19 July 2023,"For me, Barbie came very, very close to an 8/10 rating. The only reason it didn't quite get there was that it contains a few scenes that are too long and a bit too weak.On the plus side, there are several more things to mention. First and foremost, Barbie has attracted a very strong cast, with well respected names also in several supporting roles, and they all perform well. Margot Robbie was almost an obvious casting choice. With her skills and her appearance, she really IS Barbie (with a brain) for almost two hours.Director Greta Gerwig and her crew created perfect Barbieland sets, which made me smile in spite of the fact that I never owned a Barbie doll myself.The film had me laughing many times, and it also brought me to tears a few times. Quite impressive for a movie about a doll, I thought.And, last but not least, the message of the movie. Already when I heard that Greta Gerwig was going to make a Barbie movie, I knew we were in for a culture clash. The fact that she went all-in was not surprising to me, but that she managed to convince Mattel to go along with her was. Kudos not only to Greta Gerwig for that, but also to Mattel. This may turn out to prove enormously profitable for them in the end, and they undoubtedly hope to make Barbie relevant for a few more generations. Nevertheless, this took guts on their part. Well played.",Barbie

Having Barbie comment on the patriarchy just like Animal Farm about communism and Wall Street about capitalism. It's admirable and the message gets through.The problem is that the actual movie is so bad. Even though you buy in on the two worlds, etc, etc. In the end, it was like reading a textbook instead of a novel. Normally, the strengths with fables and allegories is that they are profound on many levels.

10.0,One of a kind movie,oscarg18,21 July 2023,"Barbie has exceeded the expectations of many viewers, what we thought was going to be a movie for ""kids"" has ended up being a movie full of social criticism, satire and a great sense of humor. The female empowerment that Greta Gerwig presents to us is relentless, showing various situations in which women find themselves involved on a daily basis, as well as various cliches that surround them.On the other hand, there is Ken who at first finds patriarchy as the best solution for society, but finally realizes that the role of women is extremely important and that without them society would collapse.The way in which Barbie has been shot is impressive, the mixture of the use of animated elements with life action makes seeing Barbie on the big screen a unique experience. I loved the duo of Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, they have coexisted perfectly in Barbieland, making watching them act extremely entertaining.Without a doubt, this movie is one of a kind and I would like it to be valued for what it really is and not be forgotten like the movie about Barbie.",Barbie

At times it reminded me of the recurrent joke in ""The Big Bang Theory"" about Howard not being a real scientist since he ""only"" holds a PhD in Engineering. I was a bit disappointed with the sound but it might be an artistic choice. Do words, does dialogue really matter when you are retelling how the fear of violence from one side pushed the other to unleash the most deadly and brutal attack on Japan. This is a well written movie though the ending is disappointingly cliche for a Nolan screenplay. Around the two hour mark. It felt like it was getting boring. It might benefit from some cuts. I would recommend it in a double bill with ""Hiroshima Mon Amour"".",Oppenheimer
10.0,She's more than just barbie!,ftyp-25621,21 July 2023,"The barbie movie is AMAZING. Like perfect cast, amazing references. Like Taylor swift level of references and Easter eggs. It's so clear that it's been made by women (or majority women) all departments, everywhere I hope it wins awards. I've never felt this way for a movie before but it defs was hyped up for a reason. It's a barbie movie made for everyone but it's not like a typical barbie movie (which I still love) it's so much more, once I heard Billie eilishes new song I knew it was gonna be GOOD and in depth with its story line and it was. The whole team and makers of this movie hit the nail on the head. It's genuinely become my favourite movie.",Barbie
10.0,Well done cast and crew,robandrhonda-11595,24 July 2023,"Everything about this film is top notch: acting, lighting, sound, dialogue, everything worked perfectly telling a very technical and detailed story. Well done.There were no small parts in the film. Every character was integral to the story. I see multiple award nominations and wins for this great cast. Cillian Murphy is wonderful in the lead role and his portrayal of Robert Oppenheimer has you believing at times your watching a documentary. I have been a Robert Downey Jr fan for a vey long time and this was probably his greatest performance.I am usually not a big fan of jumping around multiple timelines but this film was so well done it worked to perfection.",Oppenheimer
8.0,#justiceforken,blackhelmetman-86780,22 July 2023,"Okay I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It's funny, it's charming, and also manages to make you cry. It reminds me of the kind of movie that becomes a cult classic years later, like Napoleon Dynamite or Drop Dead Gorgeous. It's definitely not for everyone, but in my opinion the wacky bounce between spoof and serious makes it wildly entertaining. This isn't a movie to take seriously, but it is definitely thought provoking. It's take on feminism and the patriarchy is displayed in a way that is almost making fun of itself. And I think that's nice, because the movie displays a message that everyone should be equal, living a life in a patriarchal society isn't great, but neither is one designed for women. Like The Importance of Being Earnest, it nods to the problems of the world in a comedic way, making it easier to digest.My only annoyance about this film is a bit of a spoiler, so read no more if you don't want to be spoiled (I definitely recommend watching this movie btw)Ken was bashed in this movie. He was treated like garbage, and it makes me sad. The poor guy didn't know how to be happy without Barbie liking him. The guy needs a hug and a better girlfriend. Cause Barbie was kind of a jerk to him in this movie. It irked me because no one would like that aspect if the roles were reversed. Anyway, watch this movie if you want to be entertained by a wacky plot and great underlying message.",Barbie
10.0,Damn,savagebruce,22 July 2023,"I'm still processing how good this is man.This film was fire (Literally)Oppenheimer (2023) is an extraordinary film that captivated my senses from start to finish. This historical drama, directed by the brilliant Christopher Nolan, weaves a mesmerizing narrative that delves deep into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist whose work changed the course of history during World War II.From the moment the film begins, the audience is transported back in time to the tumultuous era of the 1940s, and Nolan's impeccable attention to detail immerses us into the historical setting effortlessly. The cinematography is awe-inspiring, and the breathtaking landscapes blend seamlessly with the authentic period settings, bringing Oppenheimer's world to life.The casting is nothing short of perfection. Cillian Murphy delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as J. Robert Oppenheimer, capturing the complexity and inner struggles of the enigmatic physicist with unparalleled depth. His portrayal is nuanced and compelling, allowing us to empathize with Oppenheimer's moral dilemmas and the burden he carries as the father of the atomic bomb.The supporting cast, including talented actors like Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, and Tom Hardy, further enriches the movie, elevating it to cinematic greatness. Each character is beautifully crafted and contributes significantly to the story's emotional weight.One of the most impressive aspects of Oppenheimer is its intelligent and thought-provoking script. Kudos to the screenwriters for expertly exploring the ethical questions surrounding scientific discoveries during wartime, the moral responsibilities of scientists, and the consequences of unleashing such powerful weaponry on the world.The film's score, composed by the incomparable Hans Zimmer, is nothing short of a symphonic masterpiece. It amplifies the emotional impact of every scene, pulling at our heartstrings and enhancing the overall experience.Christopher Nolan's direction is, without a doubt, a work of art. His ability to interweave historical events with human emotions and philosophical musings is nothing short of genius. He masterfully guides the audience through a rollercoaster of emotions, leaving us contemplating the consequences of our actions long after the credits roll.Oppenheimer is not merely a historical retelling; it's a powerful reflection on the frailty of humanity, the pursuit of knowledge, and the consequences of playing with forces beyond our comprehension. This film will undoubtedly leave a lasting impression on anyone fortunate enough to witness it on the big screen.In conclusion, Oppenheimer is an unparalleled cinematic experience that deserves every single one of its five stars. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction, outstanding performances, breathtaking cinematography, and emotional depth make this film a true masterpiece. It is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the power of storytelling and the impact of historical events on the course of human history.",Oppenheimer
10.0,WATCH TWICE,guaposenorbutler,26 July 2023,"""Oppenheimer "", Christopher Nolan's 11th feature film, is a character study of the man behind the Manhattan project, J. Robert Oppenheimer. This film peers into his life, achievements, relationships and flaws with the backdrop of the race to make a functioning atomic bomb first before the Nazis and then before the Soviets. Although this film, on paper, could read much like a biopic, a more accurate genre for this film would be ""thriller"" edging on ""horror"". From the first sequence, the viewer is gripped by the momentum of the film and never given a chance to recover. The editing, acting, sound design and cinematography all work in unison to push the viewer along through this complex narrative and create a truly transfixing experience. Although the initial viewing was an impressive experience, the pace of the narrative and complexity of the cast and dialogue lended to an amount of confusion that was not negligible. Upon second viewing, it was much easier to follow the plot and characters, allowing me to have a different and even more immersive and emotional experience than the first viewing. This may be a problem for some viewers who do not wish to see the movie twice, but as many Nolan fans will understand, his style of movie making challenges the viewer, and this film is no different. Though I have only seen it twice, I strongly suspect this is a film that keeps giving with every additional viewing.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Very good but complicated,dbrowning-12200,24 July 2023,"Excellent film, multilayered as another reviewer put it. I knew the story so the way it moved about from Oppenheimer's early life, the Manhattan Project, his security appeal and the Strauss confirmation hearing was known to me. However that might have been confusing to those who don't know the story. Given where Christopher Nolan is from I was surprised that the huge contribution British and Canadian scientists, among other non-Americans, seemed only to be represented by one of the British delegation who is revealed as a Soviet spy. That's the sort of thing that makes Americans think they ivented everything or won every war by themselves.",Oppenheimer
3.0,"An incoherant, boring mess",oms_holyman,24 July 2023,"Tl;DR version This film is a perfect example of how you can have all the best ingredients but if you put them together incorrectly you can end up with an unpalatable mess.We have a great story about an interesting character who played a pivotal part during one of the most decisive points in human history but sadly the real history is skimmed over in a confusing and boring fashion while the made-up history is lacklustre, obvious and stereotypical.We have some great actors who do some great acting but due to the lack of depth given to them the characters (even the main protagonists) are shallow and easily forgotten, even while still actually watching the film.We have a great musical score but the appalling sound mix exacerbates the poor story telling with the musical score overpowering and drowning out many of the character interactions. There are points of the film where the pointless noise (there was nothing going on that justified the sound being made and especially that loud) was so loud we put our fingers in our ears (note that we are used to loud noise going to rock and metal concerts) yet the one excuse the film had to overload your senses (the bomb test) was extremely underwhelming.Longer version; As someone who has a grasp of the subject matter I found it painfully hard to follow, not because it was intelligently written or cleverly crafted to draw the viewer in but because the film is little more than a mixed up mess of anecdotes, infamous ""quotes"" and the most ""entertaining"" versions of revisionist history, many of which different versions were told at different points by Oppenheimer himself.It then tries to flesh out these events by adding in made up interactions which have no bearing in recorded history and doing so without even attempting to make them realistic, instead resorting to trope stereotyping. E.g. The completely made up interactions with Einstein and the films portrayal of communism. E.g. When Oppenheimer 'miss-quotes' Property is theft because he is really intelligent and ""read it in the original German"" and is then corrected...It is not even part of Marx's philosophy. Ironically as the film goes to great lengths to point out that Oppenheimer was not actually communist this would have been a great point to distance him from communism by instead of being corrected on his pronunciation he could have been corrected to point out it is a misappropriated quote perceived by people who have little knowledge of the subject.This wouldn't be so bad if this 'artistic impression' actually made a good film but the story is told in a horribly disjointed manor which seems to have no focus or know what story it is trying to tell, made worse by the fact the sound mixing is terrible which means (considering this is primarily a talking film) you have to strain to hear, never mind understand many of the conversations as the musical score is drowning it out. Even if you join the dots you are left wondering what the point of the film actually was.There is obviously a lot of discussion if the film should be 3 hours long...The film itself could have been about an hour long and been just as 'good' while ironically the film could have been much better if it was longer or made into a trilogy so that it could have actually spent some time with the vast depth of the subject matter but it instead feels more like you skim-read a book. As this is meant to be a biopic I felt like I knew nothing of Oppenheimer at the end of it and most of the other characters apart from Matt Damon's felt more like a bunch of extras and any time they re-occurred I had to try to remember who they were meant to be.In line with it being a trilogy we can break the film down into 3 parts. The first part of the film is essentially backstory although it just skims through everything, giving you no sense of timeline or timescale and basically just 'introduces you' to a bunch of bit part characters that keep popping back up later in the film. This could have been an interesting story in of itself, exploring the 'flawed genius' of Oppenheimer, how he came to be and the political uncertainty and general turmoil of the time period which lead many disaffected people to flirt with communism. Especially in this day and age the film could have explored the mental issues it appears he suffered with throughout his life and how that affected his decisions, including the scene with the apple but then there are no anecdotes about his depression so the writers had nothing to work with.The second part of the film is really the only reasonable part because it is such a well documented part of history it has a defined narrative and is the most historically accurate but again it only skims through the subject matter. Who were most of these people? What was it like having to live in an enforced closed community in the middle of nowhere? What did all the people who didn't actually know what was going on feel when they found out what they were doing and why they were living there?There were a number of female scientists and African-Americans working on the project yet we hear/see virtually nothing about them. One female scientist gets a bit part as there is an anecdotal quote recorded in history made by her and she had to be included as the script is essentially just one big anecdotal quote and the nearest thing we get to an African-American is (if you pay attention) a token audience member during the speech after the bomb is dropped, but he didn't get a speaking part as there are no anecdotal quotes in history for him to say.This part also includes the bomb itself. The defining point of Oppenheimer, without which he would have been at best a footnote in history and more likely no-one would have even heard of him. The film barely explores his thoughts on the whole concept apart from as an excuse to insert some fancy camera effects and barely even acknowledges the though process that went behind if, when, how and where the bomb(s) should be used, with us left with a made-up anecdote of ""Kyoto is excluded as I had my honeymoon there and it was lovely"" being the depth off the decision making behind one of the defining points in history.This part also includes the one legitimate time the film has to overpower your senses, the bomb test, yet it is little more than a damp squib.While the film did not try to tell the audience what to think it also provided the audience with no information about the subject to be able to make up their own minds so essentially we are just left with another bunch of scenes with bit part characters coming and going, revolving around a few anecdotes from history and a few made up ones filling the time quota.Part 3, the part of a film where it is meant to get really interesting, the part of the film where it all comes together, the plot twist happens and you find out the point of the story. Well it appears the film is about an arrogant, self-centred egotist who feels persecuted and the twist is...it is not about Oppenheimer but instead a character whom most people have no idea who they are (and the film doesn't bother to tell you) and there is actually only subjective conjecture as to his actual role/interactions in the Oppenheimer story.Rather than being a film about Oppenheimer it appears the main focus of the film is the senate hearings for the confirmation of Lewis Strauss and the McCarthy era witch hunts which Oppenheimer got caught up in and it is believed (by some) that Strauss sold Oppenheimer out to because he was apparently obsessed by Oppenheimer based on one incident which in the skimming nature of the film it barely even touches upon and instead leads the viewer to believe it all started when Oppenheimer turned Einstein against Strauss in a made up meeting that never actually happened...but it got Einstein into the film and got to reveal his infamous white hair in a dramatic fashion. We find out why all these bit part characters from the rest of the film are simply included because they are mentioned in the transcript of his hearing and part of the 'evidence' against Oppenheimer.Summary; If you spend 5 minutes googling you will find out more about the history, story and characters involved than you will wasting 3 hours watching this film, even if can unpick the incoherent mess it is presented in.",Oppenheimer
10.0,<3,magdalinalina-54442,23 July 2023,"LOVED IT. Truly an amazing movie. A lot of people would maybe say that it's boring but to me it was super super cool, it held my attention from start to finish. Not just a movie this thing isnan experience that brings me so much joy if you go to the cinema. So many people there, dressed in pinkish clothes, feels like everyone there is happy and all of people there are unites under the idea of Barbie. The movie itself, has so many great messages to the word. I am sure a lot of little girls didn't quite understand it but they will one day. It also had so many real word/trensing things added to it.I probably liked it so much because I grew up watching old barbie movies, and now it felt like Barbie has grown with me, especially cause the topic of the movie was very real in todays world.Going in before the movie I thought it would turn out to be just ""okay"" since I saw a lot of parts from it as trailers I thought ""oh I alredy saw it all"", nahh, little did i know. Those trailers are nothing compared to this.I really reccomend watching it. But there are some parts that are ""not for kids""(ex. Some things they say, initiate...), But it's just maybe 3 times in all 114minutes of the movie.",Barbie
7.0,I'll beach you off so hard,FeastMode,20 July 2023,"I had no idea what to expect going into Barbie. I had no interest in seeing a movie about Barbie but was immediately sold on the highly talented Margot Robbie and the awesome Ryan Gosling. But I was still nervous that the comedy would be aimed strictly at women and would be difficult for a guy to enjoy.To my surprise, I didn't feel that at all. This movie is hilarious. It's the kind of stupid-funny I love, the kind usually reserved for ""dude movies."" Something you're more likely to see in a Will Ferrell movie. I was not aware Ryan Gosling could be so funny.Even though the majority of the movie is silly and fun, Margot Robbie still gives a great performance, as usual. She continues to prove she's a star. And most of the supporting cast are welcomed additions.I found Barbie highly entertaining. I think most will enjoy it, except maybe guys who are sensitive to anything empowering women or making fun of men. That's not me. The parts that made me laugh the most are the jokes about the guys.(1 viewing, early fan screening UltraScreen 7/19/2023)",Barbie
5.0,"Cute, but limiting in scope",SCManCA,23 July 2023,"Maybe I will be perceived as one of those insecure middle-aged men who is ""terrified"" of women, as labeled by another poster on here, but I assure you, I'm not.First of all, I'm gay, so I'm just here to provide a more unbiased and alternative look at the reality of what the world is nowadays when it comes to what I see between men and women. Just because I'm gay doesn't mean I don't have s lot of straight friends and I've stood on the sidelines watching their lives play out quite often. And as I've offered my observations, I've had many a ""Barbie"" say, 'Yeah, I never thought of that,' when explaining how men think, and see things.Because remember as we move forward in this discussion, for every Barbie out there, there is a Ken too. And it would indeed be interesting to see the movie, ""Ken,"" come out next. And have it written by a man. And not a man who is just trying be progressive and accepted by women. But a man who truly will give Ken's side of the story too.So let's begin with the patriarchal thing. A deep and rather complex discussion to be sure.Is there still a patriarchal mentality going on in this world? Of course. And there will continue to be for some time to come. The world doesn't just do a 180 because some movie called Barbie comes out and relegates men to some sort of inconsequential joke.Nor did it immediately do a 180 just because women were becoming more vocal about their rights some 50+ years ago (even more when you consider the right to vote).Just because we're living in a time when it's more acceptable, and cool for women to take jabs at men, doesn't mean change will be enacted overnight. Especially in light of the fact that there are still women out there who aren't ""terrified"" (to use that poster's word) of men and are perfectly fine letting them take the lead in a relationship, protect them when necessary, and do the things that men have done in relationships since the beginning of time. Remember, patriarchal societies have been around since the beginning of time, and you can't blame men for doing what they ALSO have seen as being expected of them. Many of these expectations coming from women themselves. Whether they'll admit to it or not.For those who don't subscribe to the latter though, and want to become independent, and change that patriarchal trajectory, there are indeed alternatives. And I say, go for it. We're living in an age when women don't need men. They can be pretty much anything they want to be nowadays. Are there still ""ceilings"" to be shattered? Yes. But life really isn't that bad.And what about the Barbie body image thing. For decades we've heard women complain about that impossible image that Barbie dolls have set for women. But the reality is that most men don't expect that in a woman. Not nearly as much as women might pretend or believe they do. That's more of a socialized, media construct that comes as a result of what the Barbie doll, and more generally, Hollywood and print media have set up. In the day to day world though, that's not how it is when it comes to what men expect in women.Sure, men talk about good-looking women. They ogle women. Sometimes make a catcall or two. But women talk about good-looking men too. And when a good-looking man walks in the room, there is no denying what the women in the room think of him. Hell, I saw Aladdin on Broadway and when he came out without his shirt on, muscles bulging, the women in the audience went nuts. And in the play Take Me Out during the shower scene with a bunch of hot young men naked in the shower scene, the women in the audience weren't exactly suppressing their murmurings and ""responses."" So come on!And to expand upon that, I worked at a major amusement park in Anaheim for almost ten years when I was younger. I was witness to thousands of couples. And I can tell you that I actually saw more couples where the man was better looking than the woman than I did where the woman was better looking than the man.So no, men don't expect perfection.Actually, from the observations I've made of women it would suggest that they do place a lot of importance on looks and physique when it comes to a man too. They can pretend that they don't, and that it's the men who have these impossible expectations of women, but it doesn't change the facts.In the movie, we see Barbie's perspective on things. So, this is how Ken sees it in the real world too: women want a man who is good looking, has a great body, has a full head of hair. And oh yeah, if he has a lot of money, even better.And add to that you have women who have special interests such as a man in uniform;. Or a younger man. I have female friends who will only date a guy in uniform. Etc.So do women really want to play that ""expectations"" card?I wouldn't suggest it. Because they are just as guilty as men. And any body self-image thing that women have is more Hollywood, and yes, Barbie-driven than what is the reality anyway. Because men are way more accepting than women claim them to be. Or I should say, straight men are. Gay men, not so much.I will even add that men are so accepting of women, that ageism isn't even the issue that women play it up to be. Women complain about men who only want a younger, hotter woman and that women ""age out"" and are not treated with the same respect. To that I say bull. Let's say my 50 year old female friend and I go out for dinner, and our waiter is some hot younger man. If my friend has a thing for younger men and hits on him, depending on the moment in time, that friend of mine might very well have a date for the night.I can tell you that as a gay male, that would not happen with that younger man if he was gay. If he played on my team and I made a play for him, there would only be a 5-10% chance I would have a chance at him. Because if you want to know what picky is, ask a gay man. Younger gay men won't hardly give the time of day to an older man.So straight women benefit from this as well. There is no such thing as becoming too old. There are plenty of younger men who are willing and I'll bet where I'd have a 5-10% with the dude if he played on my team, she'd have an 80-90% chance with him if he was straight. Older gay men will not see the same willingness in younger gay men that straight women do in younger straight men. And even if the younger guy wasn't interested in an older woman, he would treat her with respect. The younger gay man will very likely put the older man down.But I digress. Even though proven the point that women have nothing to complain about. Trust me.In closing, are there Ken dolls who only want Barbie? Sure. But that's not the majority.Do men appreciate a good looking woman with a nice body? Yes.But women appreciate the same in men too, so time to move on from that discussion. Both men AND women have expectations of the opposite sex.As to the patriarchal thing? Definitely a deeper and more complex subject.But still, things have changed a lot for women. I know that patriarchal societies have been around for a long time. They have been the ""norm"" so to speak. And again, a lot of women are actually still okay with that. They don't mind the man taking the lead in ther relationship, protecting them, etc.But for those who don't subscribe to that, women can now be the VP of the USA, or the prime minister or president of whole countries. We almost had a female president here in the States. Women can be CEOs, and even directors of movies. Some of the wealthiest people on this earth are women. All kinds of opportunities.Even the opportunity to get your degree, get a nice job, and find a husband who has a lot of money, is totally hot, wears a uniform, is younger, or whatever. If the latter are your things too.Women have nothing to complain about. Looks, age, none of it matters as much as you think it does. For women, the Barbie syndrome may exist, but reality would suggest otherwise.Now boo hoo for me, all of that really DOES matter when you're gay. LOL. Or COL (cry out loud). Whatever the case may be.",Barbie
10.0,Barbie is the film we need right now,parksiet,26 July 2023,"I say this without a shred of irony; Greta Gerwig's Barbie is undoubtedly the film we so desperately need right now. This is the movie of our time - a film that shows us what life and society are like now, as well as shows us how we can do better. Plus, the movie is pure joy! It's a perfect mix of existentialism, heartfelt and important social-commentary and unapologetic silliness. This is the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - and yet thanks to Gerwig's incredible script it also manages to be very a profound exploration of feminism, existentialism, the patriarchy, and masculinity all packaged in a satirical musical comedy homage to the fabric of cinema.This movie is so hard for me to review... because it's just SO GOOD! Like oh my god go see it right now, it's incredible, important, and so much fun! Genuinely, it's the most fun I've had at a movie in a long time - it's filled with pure joy and hope! Barbie exceeded all my expectations and completely lives up to the hype surrounding it! Honestly, it's pretty much a perfect film! I had a freaking blast with the movie - I loved everything it did! It's pretty much the funnest movie ever!As I write this review and reflect on the film, I had the sudden urge to revisit Greta Gerwig's breakout directorial effort; Lady Bird, and was struck by how strong and unique a voice Gerwig has as a filmmaker. Having seen her take on Little Women and now Barbie, I can easily say she is one of the most interesting and talented filmmakers working today! I'm super impressed with Gerwig as a filmmaker - all her movies are completely different and she has avoided being placed in a box. The film industry wants you to do what they know you can do very well - it wants to place filmmakers in a box, labeling someone as only a horror filmmaker, another who only does comedies, etc. Because of her ability to do LOTS of different things very well, she has been able to avoid being labeled as only one thing, making her one of the most interesting filmmakers working today. She has shown herself to be very versatile - truly on the level of Spielberg. She's easily one of the greatest of her generation. I also really love how she isn't afraid to tackle complex social issues in her films, and she somehow always manages to find really profound and interesting ways to communicate her messages. She blends social commentary with story to the point that a scene can be both emotional and profound while also hilarious and entertaining at the same time! Gerwig is also a very economical, smart storyteller - every shot, action, and line of dialogue tells us something about character or story, nothing is wasted! Plus, Gerwig seems to be endlessly creative and really commits to her visions. I've become a huge fan of Gerwig's work and Barbie has just solidified my love for her as a filmmaker!Greta Gerwig's work in Barbie is the literal definition of innovative and insightful direction with an actual authentic voice and vision to back it up. If the movie is honoured, she better come along with it. It all starts with her, and in anyone else's hands, it all falls flat. What could've been a soulless, superficial cash grab becomes something so singular, subversive, and stirring. No one could make this movie like her. She IS the movie.The secret weapon of Barbie is that magic ability Gerwig has as a writer and director to strike such a perfect balance between message and entertainment, which is something that is incredibly hard to do! Don't expect this film to be just another toy brand adaptation like the Transformers films, this is not forgettable, mindless entertainment. Barbie is trying to teach us something and has lessons that people need to hear. The commentary isn't heavy-handed or forced at all, it feels natural and, in fact, the way they comment on gender roles, masculinity and femininity, and the stereotypes of those is a lot of fun while also making you think! Like the best comedies, it is able to layer in commentary to all of the humour - the film has a really healthy sense of humour for all the themes it is exploring! I just absolutely love that in a given scene I could be laughing so hard, and yet also really engaging with the thematic and emotional material in that same scene to the extent that I did. Scenes would be both really funny and yet deep and insightful at the same time; it's very rare a film with this strong a message is this entertaining! My god Greta Gerwig is a master! Even the humour was so well done - it was so unexpected and willing to do anything! I loved it! It was a combination of both high and low-brow humour; I loved the goofiness and the slapstick elements to it, but also really loved that it managed to balance this over-the-top humour with really clever wordplay and more subtle, dryly delivered dialogue! And the fact it never took away from the seriousness or importance of a scene was just stunning to me! You can really tell Gerwig and Noah Baumbach had a lot of fun writing this one - and I'm amazed Mattel and Warner Bros allowed them to get away with some of the things they did!Though Barbie is largely silly and satirical (and yes, a ""studio movie""), there are so many moments where Greta Gerwig's singular style shines and it takes your breath away - one of the most unforgettable moments in the film is Barbie on the bench, experiencing every human emotion for the first time. (You'll know it when you see it.) I think scenes like this show that, while Barbie does have a lot to say about womanhood and coming-of-age as a woman in a complicated and contradictory world, it's ultimately just as much about what it means to be alive and be a human in general. And no one is excluded from that. (Men, I'm looking at you.)I know a lot of guys might not think they are part of the target audience for the film. But trust me, I'm a guy, and I LOVED it. I connected with so many of the themes and loved getting to see my girlfriend connect with even more of them. This movie is for everyone. Sure, women will identify with it in some areas a lot more than others will, but there is much to offer for everyone else. This movie is a film everyone needs to see, and everyone would enjoy it if they gave it a chance! Trust me, go in with an open mind and I promise you won't be disappointed.The film tells a really moving story about what it means to be a woman in today's world, and you really don't have to be a woman to be moved by it! The screenplay and themes are so well done and get better and better as the film goes on as the deeper layers begin to reveal themselves. It's truly beautiful and so heartfelt - there is so much love in this movie for women and mothers! And really when it comes down to it, this is pretty much a story about finding yourself. It's about gender roles in society and the societal construct and expression of those roles. It's about how we cope and exist with models, role models, and other influences in society. It's a breakdown of Barbie (the doll) - what she did for the world that was both good and bad, and how she could possibly help it moving forward. Gerwig wasn't afraid to rip apart the way in which Barbie is an outdated concept and represents the worst of what we think gender means, such as how it has negatively influenced body image standards for women. Gerwig also ponders the extent that the legacy of Barbie has contributed to or detracted from feminist movements - has Barbie empowered women or instead created outdated stereotypes? Greta Gerwig almost did too good of a job for Mattel! I can't believe Mattel agreed to this, it very much critiques them and Barbie at times. It's just such a smart movie and manages to cover all these topics and themes in such a natural and entertaining way without ever feeling forced!And oh my god! America Ferrera has such a powerful monologue in the film about how women have to try to navigate society and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I saw the film. It's one of the most profound pieces of writing I've seen in quite a while and it's delivered beautifully. Probably the part of the movie that's stuck with me the most since watching it. It's sending an important message to the audience while also allowing the film's narrative to move forward smoothly and efficiently. And I can't even imagine how much it will mean to all the women and girls who see the film - I know it really meant a lot to my girlfriend and has allowed many women to feel seen! America Ferrera is the film's beating heart and luminous soul, she gives such a genuinely moving performance and a show-stopping monologue that had the audience applauding. No one can write a monologue like Greta Gerwig!As I said, the film meant a lot to my girlfriend, and I wanted to include these thoughts she had after we saw it, as I think it really shows how truly important the message of this film is:""Barbie is a movie about growing up and realizing womanhood isn't all pink, pleasure, and possibility. Realizing that much of the world will hate you - always - no matter what you do, simply because of who you are. Realizing that there comes a point when you either have to accept complacency within the patriarchy, or ostracization and vilification outside of it.Or, maybe there's another way. Maybe womanhood isn't all the fun and freedom dreamed up in youth, but maybe we don't have to abandon it entirely either. Maybe, just maybe, once we accept and begrudgingly embrace the often brutal reality of our everyday existence - while still retaining our inner strength at the same time - we can better reconcile all these cultural complications and contradictions and find a way to move through the world cautiously, but authentically. Revelling in our - and the world's - flaws instead of willfully overlooking them in favour of the fantasy.",Barbie
10.0,Beyond expectations,ghanemaldawsari,20 July 2023,"The movie delivers more than i even expected.It's Nolan masterpiece.The story telling was so good and dialogue was so full of emotions and informations about this real life god ( Oppenheimer).The cast was so perfect everyone of ghem did their role so good.Cillian Murphy, Emily blunt, Robert Downey Jr & Florence pugh. And and great Rami Malek and many many others were so perfect.The way they act made me fee like the were the real characters they were representing.Music was from another world flowing through the movie perfectly.The filmmaking was impressive and amazing and the pics & the places we discovered in this movie made me fall in love even more.3 hours felt like 3 mins.This is FILMMAKING in it is PEAK.If Christopher Nolan can't get Oscar on this i really don't know if Oscar really matter if Oppenheimer got dismissed from Oscar as the movie deserves many Oscar prizes for sure.I'm happy i got first release in my country in IMAX.10/10 for me.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Another jewel added to Nolan's crown,awsafzidane,27 July 2023,"Is Oppenheimer a triumph in filmmaking?Yes.Is it one of the most important films of Hollywood?Probably.Is it Nolan's one of the best works as a director?It is not the kind of story you'd expect from Nolan, but he tells it in his trademark style. The first act is filled with conversations and courtroom styled drama scenes. This should have been boring, but due to how these scenes are presented, the audience stays hooked. The editing and the quick transitions between scenes and timelines feel a bit confusing, but that's what Nolan was probably aiming for.The second act is much better and offers some of the most tensed and thrilling moments of the year. The whole Trinity test sequence is a masterclass in build-up, elevated by the glorious visuals of Hoytema, and deafening score from Goransson. I was awestruck.The final act is a complete horror film. A darkly funny horror film. There are some jump scares in the final hour which really caught me by surprise. The acting, dialogues, plot, cinematography, score; everything is too notch here. The 2nd act might be my favourite in the film, but the final act is definitely the most well made, technically.Overall, it's definitely a great movie and worthy of the major awards. Nolan gives another proof of why he's considered among the GOATs of directing. It does has some issues which are common in his other movies too; such as, expository dialogues, poor characterization, sound mixing concealing the dialogues etc. But it's such a well made film, that you can easily look past those flaws.Cillian Murphy and RDJ give career best performances. Emily Blunt is great too. The whole talented cast deliver great scenes, even though some of them feel underutilized. Hoytema is on his way to become one of the greats. Some of the shots here reminded me of Terrence Malick films. Goransson one again proves that he had the potential of reaching the level of Zimmer.This is a monumental piece of cinema.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Better the Second Time!,edwardsjosiah,24 July 2023,"I'm a dude so take what I'm saying with a grain of salt.When I saw it for the first time, I really enjoyed it, but it was a lot to take in. I've heard talks about this movie for YEARS, and it was different than I expected. I could recognize the performances were amazing and Greg blew it out of the park with the directing and writing and I had so much fun. But all I saw was a ""fun"" movie about ""being a women?""...HOWEVER, after I left, I couldn't stop thinking about it. Now that I knew the plot I felt I had to watch again to really understand what the movie was saying. So I watched it AGAIN, and I never go to the movies twice! I was BLOWN AWAY. Not only did I see so many details about the Barbie world but got a grasp of what Greta was saying about society l. About women. Men. Corporations. Mothers. Daughters. War.Do your self a favor. Watch it! Then, watch it again! Tbh I'm probably gonna see it one more time. I've only touched the surface.",Barbie
9.0,All about Oppenheimer,mihai_scortea,23 July 2023,"This film rests on the shoulders of Cillian Murphy to portray the Universe of J. Robert Oppenheimer told in a brilliant and fantastically visceral story, seen through the masterful eyes of visionary writer/director Christopher Nolan. And Murphy is nothing less than stellar. Breathtaking. The way Nolan manages to cast a fantastic roster of brilliant actors to meet this ""first person shooter"" of a movie is a piece of art in itself, all done to support the burden that Murphy had. As with most of his films, ""time"" is overly present in the naration and the writer/director lets us figure out who, what and when in brilliant and relatively easy to get way. The editing is fantastic, by the way. Some of the scenes are presented as too exaggerated and a bit too dramatic, with an overly powerful music score that seems as an overkill at times, so they can be a bit tiring. Having said that, the ""Trinity"" scene (please see the film to figure the scene out, no spoilers here) is a tension building scene that has, probably, no equal in the not so recent movie history. It will be remembered as one of the most dramatic and superbly executed scenes of all time. Seriously. Not only that, but a subsequent ""speech"" scene is equally visceral, to the core. To sum it all up, you should not miss this piece of art and, please see it on an IMAX screen, as the director intended.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Such a fun film,StuDeb2,26 July 2023,I love this film. It's so what we need right now. A bright and happy movie that makes you smile.The way people have embraced it is amazing. People dressing up to go and see it. It's so cleverly done. Margo Robbie is stunning and brilliant as Barbie. Ryan Gosling was the right pick for Ken. He has that cheeky charm and vulnerability down to a tee. He is such a great performer and dancer. If you ever had a Barbie this will bring back memories. It's got it's political undertones and it's trying to get a message across. But it's a film I think will be doing the rounds for a long time with the likes of Mamma Mia.,Barbie
1.0,A Talent for the Obvious,inframan,23 July 2023,"Just as they did with White Noise (based on a phenomenal book by Don DeLillo, btw), Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach take an existing cultural institution which already possesses immense iconic satirical qualities and overwhelmly trash it with unnecessary hokey jokey business. (See the final supermarket so-called dance scene in White noise - itself lifted from a far better version in the final scene of the Japanese remake of Zatoichi). This couple should run a torture garden for a spy agency: they have such an immense grasp of the obvious, they will pummel your senses to smithereens. You will never recall when the Jokers grin of insane happiness was not permanently distorting your lips. What have we done to deserve this? You name it. At least they didn't cast Adam Driver as Ken.",Barbie

This movie is great , i usually don't watch movies with high hopes but i did with this one and still it surprised me . The marketing crew did an insanely perfect job , the hole mall was wearing pink and it helped people on building the hype for the movie.

5.0,"Camp is fun, being beaten over the head isn't",coolsvillesucks,22 July 2023,"The camp in the movie was creative and fun. That part of the movie was a 10/10. Having a character yell at you for two minutes about how hard being a woman is isn't creative and fun. That part of the movie was a 1/10.But I still did love the movie. I was laughing throughout most of the movie. The sets, the costumes, the small jokes were all so wonderful. The Barbie world feels totally separate and complete. Ryan Gosling was really the star of the movie for me. Every moment he was on screen I loved it. The moments I didn't love, were really hard to get through. I loved the take of Barbieland being a total matriarchy, but I really didn't need to be beaten over the head with a stick for two minutes to get the point they were trying to make.",Barbie
7.0,Not Christopher Nolans strongest film but it delivers.,cruise01,22 July 2023,"3.5 out of 5 stars.Oppenheimer is a pretty fair biographical thriller film about Robert Oppenheimer and his invention of the nuclear bomb.First of all it is a Christopher Nolan film which he delivers a non linear story structure which follow Oppenheimer. And than a black and white sequence which follows Lewis (Robert Downey Jr.) perspective. It is a strong biographical film. Nolan mastered himself at telling the story with a moving script.The film builds the suspense with Oppenheimer rising to building the first nuclear bomb. After the first bomb test which does fail to be cinematic or spectacular that the direction tries to aim for.Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, and the rest of the cast ensemble did great. It does have a variety of familiar faces. The performance is great.What disappointed with the film is the film drags after the bomb test. It flashes between sequences with Lewis testifying against Oppenheimer. Talks of him being a communists or a spy. It just falls into one long hour of back and forth talk of his side of story and Lewis. It falls very flat. Especially it is a three hour film. The suspense and build up leads to a disappointment of one long dull film.Nolan tries to entertain the audience with his loud music or noise in the background of thumping noises or flashes of the atoms exploding. The music score was also okay but nothing special. I am a huge Chris Nolan fan of all his films. This film falls right with Insomnia with being the weakest. It has a great cast and story. And direction. The script falls flat in the last hour which is more frustrating viewing than actually watching a strong film.Oppenheimer is an okay film and a one time watch kind of movie and forgotten after it ends. I was a little disappointed.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Destroyer of Worlds,aciessi,23 July 2023,"Here is what you need to know. Oppenheimer is one of the best films of the decade. This is a film you must see, regardless of whether or not you watch a lot of movies. See it on the biggest IMAX screen you can. It is as much an engrossing document of vital history as it is an unparalleled sensory experience. This film is of course about the invention of nuclear weaponry, and of course, you'll get up close and personal to a real detonation. But that's nowhere near the thrill behind Oppenheimer. In fact, there isn't supposed to be one. Oppenheimer is a blistering indictment of the bomb's creation and a passionate anti-war plea. What's more, is that this is a masterful character study about the man behind the bomb, and the agonizing regret he felt about creating it in the first place.J. Robert Oppenheimer was a curious physicist who in one lifetime received the ultimate praise and the ultimate ire from the nation he belonged to. Summoned by the U. S. military, he served as the brains behind the Manhattan Project and the creation of the first, second and only atomic bombs ever used in battle. For that moment, Oppenheimer brought about the brutal end of a world war, but that was exactly the problem. A brutal end to a brutal war, and forever, the world had changed. Oppenheimer gave birth to the first weapon of mass destruction, and every nation on earth wanted one of their own. The arms race was on. The end of the world, suddenly, a possibility. If that weren't enough already, his greatest scientific ally betrays him in a stunning act of jealousy and personal enrichment, leading to a demoralizing persecution at the hands of the U. S. Government at the height of the red scare.Oppenheimer becomes the physical manifestation of guilt and yes, death. Wracked with unending pain, we see his body begin to consume itself. His eyes stare straight into the abyss. His frame, gaunt and emaciated. Always seemingly on the verge of tears. Cillian Murphy delivers an unforgettable performance that I struggle to think won't land him an Oscar next year. For three hours, Murphy is spellbinding, and that is incredible given the fact that for the most part, he is simply talking with other people. Oppenheimer, by that affect, is not a laborious chore to sit through, but instead, a living and breathing historical account. Robert Downey Jr., as the backstabbing Lewis Strauss is instantly the clear front runner for Best Supporting Actor in a performance that mirrors F. Murray Abraham in Amadeus.Oppenheimer is many great movies in one, and for Christopher Nolan, that comes with so much ease. In every aspect, he approaches the material with the gravity it deserves and not once does it meander and and lose focus of the core information behind the story. That unto itself is a tremendous undertaking, and without a doubt, Nolan passes that test.",Oppenheimer
10.0,"""I Am Become Death, The Destroyer Of Worlds""",virek213,28 July 2023,"He was deemed ""The Father of the Atomic Bomb""-a man whose core studies on the nature of the universe and the atom itself led to the development of the ultimate Weapon of Mass Destruction; and in his life, he was accused of being a Communist, particularly after his invention (or two of them) atomized Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He was J. Robert Oppenheimer (or ""Oppie"" to his ""fans"" in the world), But while his story is fairly well known to anyone who has studied the history of America from World War II through to the Cold War, it took British director Christopher Nolan to truly bring his epic story to the big screen, which he has done so with OPPENHEIMER.Adapted to the screen by Nolan from the book ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, OPPENHEIMER stars Cilia Murphy as the legendary and (frequently) legendarily controversial scientist whose studies in quantum physics unlock the great secret of the creation of the universe, but which, in the 1930's, were put to use for a much more disturbing purpose. In order to keep this disturbing purpose totally under wraps, Oppenheimer devised the entire building of a small town in New Mexico called Los Alamos. But both his advocacy for unions inside the professions of professors, teachers, and scientists and his loose associations with people who may have (suspected) ties to the Communist Party make him the subject of scrutiny by the U. S. government, particularly the FBI (very much under the control of J. Edgar Hoover). He nevertheless gets support in the development of The Bomb from legendary General Leslie Groves (Matt Damon), Albert Einstein (Tom Conti), and fellow nuclear physicist Edward Teller (Benny Sadie) and the great Danish scientist Niels Bohr (Sir Kenneth Branagh). Overall, this makes OPPENHEIMER very much a political drama and an historical drama all in one, with Murphy's performance giving us insight into the psychology and psyche of this great and, in many ways, troubled American genius, and also a look at how America, from the 1940's onward, seemed hell bent on containing the evils of Communism with a nuclear weapons program that, if ever used for real, would wipe out every living thing on Earth.Nolan, known for such great films as 2009's INCEPTION, 2014's INTERSTELLAR, and 2017's DUNKIRK, may have made an incredibly long film out of his subject, with a running time of three hours, but he certainly makes the most of it, particularly in the intense and frightening countdown to the device's test detonation in the New Mexico desert in July 1945. Emily Blunt is quite good as Oppenheimer's wife Kitty; and the supporting turns from Damon, Conti, and Branagh are top-notch all the way. And finally, Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is a portrayal clearly worthy of being awarded, particularly a very likely nomination for Best Actor at the Oscars.Clearly, this is a masterpiece, and worthy of a '10' rating.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Had me smiling all the way through,a-hilton,23 July 2023,"Okay maybe it was a 9.5 because of two flaws: First was the Will Ferrell character and his board that made their point but then became superfluos. Second was that it is definitely not a kids' movie (although maybe they would see things that I didn't - I mean to be fair, the few kids in the theatre were well behaved so perhaps the movie got their full attention as well).But why did I enjoy it? Simply amazing visuals, Margot Robbie looked flawlessly gorgeous and played it perfectly. Ryan Gosling was also brilliant in this. Great music, great pacing and then there was the script. There were a lot of messages in this film that trod a tightrope between pithy, ironic, sarcastic and cliched. But I reckon they just about managed it which, considering the subject matter, was quite an accomplishment. I will need to see it a second time to check whether the messages were balanced and as meaningful as they were meant to be but I hope that women were as upbeat about it as i was. Overall, on an enjoyment level alone, it deserves its high score from me.",Barbie

9.0,Absurdist Feminist Masterpiece,TheSurrealist,21 July 2023,"With movies like Everything Everywhere All At Once and Beau Is Afraid having come out recently, Barbie is the next in a line of a clearly developing trend of absurdism, meta commentary, and surrealism to create a wacky, funny, beautiful, and touching film about some type of social commentary. With Barbie, we get commentary on feminism, consumerism, and existentialism. It leans perfectly into its brightly colored world and plasticky fakeness to help elevate its commentary and rich cast. The costume, makeup, and set design are lavishly created and I wouldn't be surprised if it won Oscars for all of these categories. The cast does a fantastic job, and I don't think there could have been a better Ken or Barbie. Greta Gerwig was always going to make this more than just a family movie. It's a feminist masterpiece chock full of over the top pop culture nods, perfectly timed comedic quips, and genuine emotional moments that make you think.",Barbie
7.0,"Too long, but worth seeing",Apollocandybar,24 July 2023,"At least 30 minutes could be cut without losing any of the story. The time jumps are confusing, though not as frenetic as in Dunkirk. The story is interesting, and the acting is well done. The film fails the Bechdel test in every way, and is in that regard an anti-Barbie. There are a few female characters, but they only exist to expound the story of men. Kitty especially should have been featured more, rather than a crabby and bitter shell. Why was she so miserable? We can imagine, but would've been great to see her story.The weirdest thing they did was leave Murphy's double pierced ear visible in multiple closeup scenes. It was distracting and easily fixable.",Oppenheimer
7.0,Good film - Maybe someday I'll regain my hearing,SDAim2,26 July 2023,"Well, Oppy is quite an experience. In many ways it's an amazing film, BUT... it's stubbornly nonlinear, as if someone shuffled the storyboards. And somewhat impressionistic. I think Nolan was trying to capture in visuals both the psychological noise of that super-secret project and the zeitgeist of that pressure-packed era - without abandoning the narrative. At 3 hours in length, it's probably not everyone's cup of tea - I realized halfway through I wished we had gone to a theatre with reclining chairs. It really helps if you know the arc of Oppenheimer's story, or at least the moral ambiguity that tempered the scientific deadline to develop a device that ""could"" end life on earth.Caveat: if you're taking your dad, and he just got a pacemaker, bring ear plugs for him. Nolan and his sound designer play audio pranks throughout the film, following a quiet or silent passage with sudden deafening sound.",Oppenheimer

I could feel sound and pressure in my chest throughout the film. I was paralyzed in my seat until the final hour of the film.I watched it in my local IMAX theater, which is an amazing theater, but somehow I feel like I still did it a disservice because I didn't watch it in 70mm.

8.0,A Satire On Human Species and A Tale of Time.,andrejmicic,19 July 2023,"The Barbie movie had a very easy going start with parties, colors, and making fun of stereotypes. It's all very musical-like untill Barbie asks the question about dying which can be seen in trailer.The movie slowly starts to take itself more seriously and when Barbie goes to the ""Real World"" she faces problems that modern woman has. Ken also has to face the ""Real World"" but does it in his own way. It was very cool seeing two characters detached from reality and having completely different view on the world face the ""reality"" and carry themselves with it. It makes the characters more fleshed out which the movie does well, as i've got a feeling that Barbie and Ken in particular are behaving just how they were imagined to since they were first made.Time and Change are factors that are actually displayed through small cameos and at the ending itself, but have a very important meaning and are factors that should be thought about after you watch the movie.Ultimately, the ""agenda"" goes from funny jokes to actual rants towards the end of the movie but it all comes a full circle and sends a strong message.The music and cinematography are very cartoonish and nice, so is the dialogue. The references to other media are very cleverly put throughout the movie as well. The dialogue at the beginning is made to look like kids actually playing with those dolls but facing the reality is actually a very good space for character development, and Barbie used that very good. Even tho some ""agendas"" are pushed throughout the movie, it ultimately sends a good message, and does what Barbie is supposed to do : to inspire girls and make them feel strong for who they are.",Barbie

The beginning was hopeful and I loved the cast and the amazing set of Barbie Land. Barbie's playhouse was amazing! But as it went on, it became way too political and preachy and went downhill. If I did this movie, I would have made it a love story between Ken and Barbie and had them get married, making use of all the cool Barbie toys and her friends. But of course that would have been strangely politically incorrect, even though that's what most people still do these days. So it was a way cool set, amazing cast, but way too political for my taste.",Barbie

Christopher Nolan has once again exceeded all expectations with this film, leaving me in awe during the entire 20-minute walk back home.The combination of an exceptional cast and mesmerizing soundtracks perfectly brought Nolan's vision to life. I can't help but hope that Murphy receives the Oscar he truly deserves for his outstanding performance.Admittedly, if you're not familiar with the historical context of the film's topic, you might feel a bit lost or uninterested. However, I assure you it's still worth watching for its sheer brilliance and cinematic prowess.

8.0,"Barbie: Beautiful, Bold, and (Somewhat) Brilliant",thereisonlymatthewman,22 July 2023,"Greta Gerwig continues to prove herself as a leading filmmaker in today's industry. In what is one half of the ""Barbenheimer"" experience, many would be quick to assume that given the subject matter, ""Oppenheimer"" is the superior film that makes you think, while ""Barbie"" is the film where you turn your brain off and enjoy the silliness. And while the movie is undeniably silly, it proves throughout its runtime that it's something more. ""Barbie"" is beautiful, bold, and (somewhat) brilliant.The beauty of ""Barbie"" lies in the sheer talent of its cast. Margot Robbie shines yet again, giving it her all in the titular role. By playing the stereotypical Barbie, she lives in Barbieland and enjoys time with her friends in her dreamhouse and on the beach. But through certain cracks in her perfect world that lead to an existential crisis, Barbie is forced to change and go through her Hero's Journey. Margot Robbie plays this role beautifully, showing the contrast between the Barbie who has a perfect life and the Barbie who learns what life is all about. She may not get any awards or nominations, but Margot Robbie is deserving of recognition once again.This film is bold, and that quality is personified in none other than Ken, played wonderfully by Ryan Gosling. Throughout this story, you get the sense that Ken is just another trivial member of Barbieland, only existing as a secondary accessory to Barbie. When he joins Barbie on her journey, Ken is focused on helping because he wants Barbie to succeed. This changes once the pair enter the human world. Ken learns about the patriarchy, and realizes he wants something more for himself. Ryan Gosling is a true scene stealer, and should get award consideration. Gosling is fun, goofy, and shows off his dancing and singing skills displayed in past films. But when Ken learns of the value of men, he finally feels accepted and important when all he knew was to serve someone else's story. Gosling portrays this magnificently, another reason for Barbie's success.However, while the film brilliantly explores themes of purpose and identity, it falls flat in its delivery of a message regarding feminism and the patriarchy. Throughout the film, Barbie is described as a concept for all girls to look up to. The patriarchy and its negative impact is mentioned ad nauseam, causing some eye-rolling reactions from me. But Sasha (Ariana Greenblatt), who starts off a harsh critic of Barbie, explains the irony in the Barbie doll. Barbie is supposed to be the girl to look up to, but historically the doll is just capitalism and consumerism at its finest. And while it's important to show the power of having women in charge and the dangers of the patriarchy, the message is so blunt and preached to the audience, unlike the other important themes.""Barbie"" is a wonderful viewing experience, with the bright colors, goofiness, and dance numbers you'd expect and the emotional heft that'll stick with you. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are worthy leads, but the rest of the cast deserves recognition for putting their all in the role they were given. The movie is powerful, but there are times when it slips and preaches to us rather than showing us. Overall a great time, and if you truly want to maximize your experience, a ""Barbie"" chaser to the ""Oppenheimer"" feast is perfection.",Barbie
6.0,Expected more from Greta Gerwig,JPARM-IMDb,26 July 2023,"Even though I'm not the target audience for this movie, I thought Barbie might impress me due to Greta Gerwig's previous works but I'm disappointed.The main problem is that the overall message isn't clear. This doesn't go to say that the movie is frivolous. What happens is that it gets lost trying to get around multiple meaningful topics and never reaches the punchline. It addresses relevant themes like patriarchy, sexism, gender roles, existencialism, imperfection, individuality and identity but always on a shallow level. Every scene in this script tries to convince you that it's saying something profound when in reality it sacrifices depth and character development in favor of cheap humor, which results in an immature and non-compelling production.In contrast, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling were perfectly casted and their performances are as good as the screenplay allows them to be. The production and costume design from Barbie Land are noteworthy too.Hopefully Greta Gerwig will release other movies in the future as brilliant as Lady Bird, which I genuinely think deserves 5 stars.",Barbie
6.0,"Better than Tenet, I guess?",slp-22338,23 July 2023,"Not great, not terrible. A whole hour too long. Too convoluted, no clear through line. Same problem Nolan started having with Dunkirk and Tenet, no real character development or motivations. Yes, Oppenheimer ""states"" his reasons for being interested in quantum mechanics and then the bomb, but it's just that. Telling, not showing. A lot of back story happens off screen. Ugh.Make me feel something. Make me care about the characters. The subject matter alone is incredibly interesting (and offers a potentially great internal moral dilemma) but Nolan somehow fubbed it up by trying to make Oppenheimer be about more, like the Red Scare, 20 freaking years after Japan surrendered. It's weird like, what did he really want this movie to be about?There was some great moments, to be sure. Matt Damon stole every scene he was in. The bomb exploding was da bomb. Photography, stunning, but of course. The music was dope, BUT, even that was gratuitous. Literally every single scene had that same sort of weird intense escalation score under-riding it. Cool at first but it got old real quick. It felt like everything on screen was oh so important and thrilling, when in fact, most of the time it wasn't. (When everything's important nothing is.)I just, I dunno. I used to love Nolan's work. This was a boring convoluted mess coming from the mastermind who brought us Memento and The Prestige, both of which are near perfection in concept and execution. I'm more disappointed in him than anything, as more and more he's becoming the sort of self-indulgent director who forgot about the audience's experience entirely. Shame.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Nolan strikes gold again : 'Oppenheimer' deserves all the acclaim!,prahlad_writes,28 July 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" is an awe-inspiring masterpiece that exemplifies Christopher Nolan's unparalleled brilliance as a filmmaker. Rarely does a film possess such profoundness that it leaves me utterly speechless. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer is nothing short of extraordinary, capturing the complexities of the character with sheer brilliance. The entire ensemble cast delivers exceptional performances, elevating the film to greater heights.Nolan's directing prowess shines through every frame, weaving a gripping narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The editing is seamless, effortlessly transitioning between timelines and character perspectives, adding layers of depth to the storytelling. Ludwig Goransson's haunting score complements the film's emotional depth, enhancing every scene with a perfect blend of intensity and poignancy. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the essence of each era with stunning visual elegance.""Oppenheimer"" reaffirms Nolan's reputation as a visionary storyteller, masterfully blending history, science, and human drama into a profound cinematic experience. It is a thought-provoking exploration of the moral dilemmas surrounding scientific advancements and their far-reaching consequences.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" stands as one of Christopher Nolan's finest works, an exquisitely crafted symphony of storytelling that resonated deeply with me. It is a true testament to the power of cinema and a must-watch for anyone seeking an intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant cinematic journey.",Oppenheimer
8.0,You are Kenough,Genti25,20 July 2023,"This movie is so much fun. It starts off really strong although the story does move away from ""Barbieland"" sooner than I would have liked. Nonetheless, it regains its footing with the final act in particular and I could not stop laughing at Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken. That song will forever be stuck in my head.There are also plenty of good messages to be taken away from this experience, that is if you're not an insecure middle-aged male terrified of women. I loved everything the movie had to say about the patriarchy and barbies and growing up and consumerism and so much more.I am excited to watch it again soon. The pacing is not perfect and its huge potential is not fully matched, but purely as a cinematic experience I will never forget this movie.",Barbie
8.0,Barbie discovers the not so perfect world.,Ruben17,20 July 2023,"It's weird yet fun movie! It keeps getting better by the minutes, had a good portion of fun but also a few emotional moments.It's not made for everyone but try and keep a clear mind while watching it!The casting choice were sublime and each Barbie, Ken and even Alan nailed there performances.The few cameos were also pretty fun, and with a lovely touch at moments.Some scenes were a bit dragged out but because of the characters it kinda felt like i was okey with it.It has it ups and downs but it was mostly entertaining and i think that was it's main goal and they succeeded in that.If you are a Barbie fan you'll definitely have a blast!",Barbie
10.0,Surprisingly Amazing For Everyone!,baxroth,19 July 2023,"Barbie was honestly a pleasant surprise, I went as a joke thinking it would be stupid but ended up loving the movie. The acting and humour were perfect and everything was so well done. The storyline was incredibly good for a movie about dolls and I am honestly impressed. The soundtrack was great and the songs sung were even better. The effects and sets were perfect for the theme and plot and it just worked so well. I absolutely loved it and hope it does well at the box office because it deserves so many awards. Margot Robbie, great. Ryan Gosling, amazing. Michael Cera, better than ever. Will ferrel, yes! John Cena, best character. Great movie everyone should watch!!!",Barbie
10.0,Cinematic Masterpiece,leanne-elizabeth,24 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan movies have always been an acquired taste. I remember when Inception was released and there were mixed responses from the audience from ""Absolutely brilliant"" to ""What on Earth did I just watch?"" I love this about Nolan. His movies are designed to make us ask questions, to make us use our brains. We have become lazy in our viewing of entertainment. We want action packed explosions and everything handed on a plate and tied up in a little bow at the end. This is not that. Acting performances were superb from all parties. It is a theatrical, cinematic masterpiece. This movie is not about Oppenheimer being put on trial. This movie is about humanity being put on trial. It's a movie that needs to be watched more than once, like all Nolan movies, to truly be able to take in all of the amazing creativity, writing, music and acting. Is it essential to view in IMAX? Perhaps not. But, I really think this movie is something to be experienced, not to just be watched. That is what makes cinema special. Cinema isn't just watching a movie, it's experiencing a movie. Oppenheimer in an IMAX cinema was an experience that I am unlikely to forget.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Hilarious and touching,sarahbollmann,20 July 2023,"The most fun I've had at the cinema in a long time. The jokes are meta and hilarious. The performances all through spectacular. This was like a fever dream and I can't wait to take all my friends to the cinema to watch this movie again and again. I did not expect to be so entertained but also shedding tears. A movie everyone should go and watch. And how beautiful that Billie Eilish song was! We will definitely hear it live next year at the Academy Awards, where I hope Greta and the whole team will get recognition for creating this (already) iconic film. Production design, script, directing, acting (especially Ryan bodied that role) and Best original song I would want to see awarded.",Barbie
3.0,"Men are trash, but now make it pink",softwatcher,23 July 2023,"Before I start this review, let me start by saying that I used to be a staunch feminist. I'm certain that once upon a time, this film would have been right up my alley. I would have been nodding along with America Ferrera's infamous 30-min monologue in the second act (was it thirty minutes? It felt like thirty minutes). I would have been cheering when the women finally wrested back power. I would have been disgusted at the instatement of the patriarchy in Barbieland.Now, this sort of narrative tires me, especially when it's so cringy and on the nose. I was expecting true woman power out of this film - a glorification of all that it means to be a woman, especially since Barbie has always been the epitome of femininity. Instead, we have the same repackaged message that being a woman is a torturous, inferior experience, and that you must escape it at all costs. We have the same narrative that men are literal trash and that they will succumb to their basest instincts at first chance.Really, we have the same old, same old: ""Women can do it all"" - we cannot - ""Women don't need men"" - yes, we do - ""Men are asinine, useless, selfish, and egoistic"" - sure, like all women are, if we're making generalizations - ""Loving others by serving them is demeaning"" - serving others is the ultimate form of love and should be uplifted, appreciated, and glorified. Instead, this film shows women in maid costumes to make the point that serving others is h0rribl3!!!11!We were supposed to get a visceral reaction to this image of women as maids - and I did, because it was so artless, cringy, and reductive - and make the connection that the patriarchy enslaves us. What the patriarchy does is simply split labor. Men outside the home, women within. Is that inherently bad? Or does it simply make sense based on men's and women's distinct strengths, at least historically? We must question. You will likely have a different answer than I.I liked some of the messages at the beginning, namely that women are so often subject to impostor syndrome. That was beautiful, but then later on the film takes it upon itself to trample men to ""uplift"" women. I did not feel uplifted. I felt betrayed and pandered to, except I was the wrong crowd. It ignores the hardships of being the dominant sex: Being expected achieve, perform, earn more, lead, provide, protect, wear an emotionless facade. In some respects, women have it easier than men.When America Ferrera, whom I just want say I adore, was doing her monologue on how it sucks to be a woman due to what's expected of us, all I could think was, ""Yes. There are certain expected behaviors of both women and men. It's called basic public decency and decorum.""For instance, men are expected to be dominant and aggressive, but not so aggressive as to be frightening. Men are expected to hide their emotions, but not be emotionless brutes. If we started on this route, we could pick apart just about anything.This sort of monotone, flat representation of our complex human experience works well to get a crowd fired up, but it's ultimately reductivist. I walked away feeling like the director thought I was stupid.What I did like was the aesthetic, the much more subtle commentary on American consumerism, and the representation of teenagers are oversensitive militants. That's it.",Barbie
9.0,Near-perfect biopic that demands your attention,harrymego,24 July 2023,"Let's be honest here. This isn't your average World War II film; filled with violent war scenes and American nationalistic themes.This is a slow-building biopic about one man's genius being imparted on one of the most noteworthy endeavors of the 20th century - The Manhattan Project, which resulted in the atomic bomb.Oppenheimer is well-produced, well-acted and beautifully shot. Cillian Murphy emits the perfect disturbed look that Oppenheimer has become famous for, and the attention to detail surrounding his character is on point.The only negative aspect of Oppenheimer is how much it can demand your attention. Because it's so rich, it's very easy to miss something important. If you miss a few details about the intricacies of the story it can ruin the immersion. However, the second time through makes it much more understandable.All in all, this is a solid Nolan movie and a great addition to his ever-growing library of classics.",Oppenheimer
8.0,"Refreshing and Creative, More Than Just a Gimmick",Dan_W_Reviews,21 July 2023,"Barbie is a delightful and creatively refreshing comedy that breathes new life into the iconic doll's world. From the moment the film began, I was captivated by its smart and subversive storytelling, which cleverly blends meta-humour with a dash of eccentricity.The production design is a standout feature, a visually dazzling and wonderfully pink-themed universe. Margot Robbie's portrayal of Barbie is nothing short of impressive, skilfully capturing both the character's earnestness and humour. Her performance, combined with Greta Gerwig's skilful directing, makes for a truly entertaining and memorable experience.Throughout the film, I found myself chuckling at the witty humour and enjoying the unexpectedly bold take on what Barbie represents. The movie strikes a fine balance between honouring the iconic brand and playfully challenging its conventions, resulting in a unique and rewarding cinematic experience.While the film's intentions are commendable, there were moments when it felt like the themes could have been explored more deeply, leaving me slightly wanting more. Nonetheless, Barbie remains a fun and enjoyable ride, filled with charm and charismatic performances that made it stand out as one of the year's best comedies so far.In the end, Barbie proves to be much more than just a marketing gimmick, showcasing a refreshing take on a beloved cultural icon and making it a must-see for anyone seeking a smart, humorous, and visually arresting cinematic adventure.",Barbie
7.0,Barbie is fun!,skylermoore,24 July 2023,"As a skeptical viewer, I went into this expecting cheesy bad. I am happy to say that this movie is fun! Is it for everyone? Absolutely not. It's a great mixture of adult humor and fun and kids humor and fun without ever feeling like it dives into one or the other too much. There's surprisingly a beautiful emotional sequence TWICE and it delivers a great message while poking fun at Barbie and Mattel. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gossling prove to be the amazing actors they are known for and this is packed with a great supporting cast. Yes the plot is thin, yes it's a little bare bones and yes there's some minor pacing things here and there. But for what it is I liked this movie a lot. I will be watching again on streaming!",Barbie
2.0,Genuinely disappointed and disgusted.,cmzmsnw,22 July 2023,"This movie was awful and definitely not kid friendly. It turned a beautiful childhood toy and turned it into a horrid mess. It wasnt funny or entertaining. Any hope for entertainment was lost immediately. Any innocence that was held by barbie was quickly abandoned by the creators. The fact that mattel allowed for such sexual references and cursing is truly beyond me. Yes this is supposed to be barbie going to the real world and figuring out how life actually is, however it could have been done in a way where what she stands for was gracefully held intact. Instead of letting barbie go into the real world and face independence as she stands for instead of gross references to genitalia would be a start for a better movie.",Barbie
9.0,deceivingly great,clarkey_me,24 July 2023,"Wasn't sure how it would go however so much funnier then i expected, and definitely more of an adult film then i expected too, thought it was going to be aimed at the barbie loving 4 year olds however lots of laugh's throughout both jokes and other little subtle jokes like the CEO with his pink drum sticks and not being able to get through the locked gate with his swipe card as Barbie hops over the top and loved how it flipped between Barbie world and the normal world. Would highly recommend and would totally go back and see again and buy once out. Loved how everyone also gets in barbie theme and go dressed in pink.",Barbie

It is one the most original movie made in terms of writing, filming, cinematography, in recent times to be made with a fake subject but very relevant plot!Barbie speaks to alot of women and MEN about feminism, patriarchy, consumerism and existentialism in its own weird, sometimes cringe but mostly funny way.Full Marks for Casting. Top to toe perfect casting for Barbie and Ken. But movié is boring in the beginning and too preachy otherwise.Totally skippable in the theatres. Its not worth the hype tbh.",Barbie
8.0,"A lot better than I expected! Amazing, with a bit of a stretched ending",t-37410-88589,20 July 2023,"I expected this movie to be a quick predictable cashgrab with as much stars as possible for the poster, it turned out to be way more. It has its flaws, but they quickly move past that.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling absolutely killed it. It had great social commentary, while still being funny and wildly entertaining. The design is great, from set design to music to choreography. It's a feast to see all those stars dancing together, and the use of color is amazing.The story was well illustrated, with showing you the message clearly, they sometimes straight up tell you things, but those things are well explained in the context.The real world part didn't stick to its own rules, sometimes it was complete fantasy when it needed to be, and sometimes it was supposed to be ""harsh reality"" which therefore just didn't work. Cliché's and tropes were sometimes a bit too much, but I didn't really expect something else than that. The end-conversation was a bit pretentious, and a bit weaker than it tried to be for me. I could understand that it hit all the right spots for somebody else. The jokes were great, and I laughed a lot. Loved how it looked like the lego movie sometimes.8,2/10 Well done. Now Im gonna watch Oppenheimer.",Barbie

Yes, three hours may seem long, but it surely wasn't a waste of time at any point in the movie, the way they filmed it, how it was written, all the actors as well as the roles they got just fit together in a great harmony and beauty.I just want to say how great full I am to have gotten the honour to see this masterpiece. It was breathtaking and a truly remarkable and astonishing experience.

9.0,Oppenheimer meets its objectives.,pavan116,28 July 2023,"Well, I'm not sure why everyone is criticising the movie when it's actually quite good.Few people are comparing this movie to Barbie because of their release dates being so close together. It should be emphasised that both are not comparable.The actor Cillian Murphy portraying Oppenheimer in the film was superbly portrayed by Nolan. The visuals that he created without using VFX or CG demonstrate Nolan's commitment to the film. All of the actors had outstanding performances, and the casting is excellent. The Subjective and Objective points of view of the characters were masterfully done in the screenplay. Everyone assumed that this was solely about the development of the atomic bomb, but in truth, Oppenheimer overcame his argument regarding his security clearance.Every segment of the audience should see this film.",Oppenheimer
3.0,One Time watch on OTT,SherShah,26 July 2023,The trailer and promotions of the movie seem to be about Manhattan project but on contrary it has too many sub plots pre and post Manhattan project. The political drama aspect explored in the movie remain very superficial and don't really grip the viewer.The viewer need to have knowledge of the political environment of 1950s in the USA. The movie doesn't give background before describing the events that occur during McCarthy era.There was also not much in the movie for big screens and iMax. The movie is more an abstract autobiography of Dr Oppenheimer.It is one time watch movie on the OTT and fell short of movies associated with Christopher Nolan.,Oppenheimer
10.0,Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus,zamgion,21 July 2023,"If Christopher Nolan had died today, this would be his magnum opus.I had the pleasure of viewing Oppenheimer on a film screening. While not on an Imax Film screening, it was a 5 perf 70mm screen. If you have the opportunity to see this movie on ANY film medium, please do so.The film shows great respect to it's viewers, throwing you straight into the action. It hooks you in so easily. The performances are some of the best performances I have ever seen. The film is 3 hours long, yet keeps you entranced in it's ever-growing and progressing plot. Without revealing many spoilers, I can say the following.This is Christopher Nolan's best film. It's a collaboration to do something new, to make a bio-pic, and to tell a story which just hasn't been told before with a combined effort and learning from all of his past.If you have the chance to see Oppenheimer, do so. If it means staying up until 1 in the morning, do so. It is a film which will keep itself in your mind. It is addictive.",Oppenheimer
7.0,Dutch is not Deutch,EvaenAppie,22 July 2023,"Don't get me wrong, Christopher Nolan did a great job making this movie. It was a suspenseful, historically important movie. However, I am very disappointed that a movie that probably has cost a lot of money to make, did not even bother to check whether the Dutch (scene which was shot in Leiden) actually made sense. It was in fact, not Dutch, but German. This, especially considering that the timeline was during WW2, is shameful. WW2 was a difficult time for the Dutch, of which survivors, including my own grandma, are still alive. Older generations can take offence to this mistake, and it is just very sloppy.",Oppenheimer

6.0,A Barbie World?,baharperwrites,21 July 2023,"I am so torn, on this movie. There is no doubt, that Barbie is beautifully made movie, with an awesome cast and an amazing creative team. Margo Robbie was born to play Barbie and lets be honest Ryan Gosling stole the entire movie. Then again I can't think of a single cast Member I didn't like. The references are amazing, as a boy with a sister, I grew with Barbie so I recognised a lot things. But, I did not care for the writing and some of the movies messages, were not just bad, but problematic. I was going to go into details about all the things that bothered me, but I'm not spoiling anything. I don't hate this movie, by any means, but I don't love it either. I think the target audience will love it, and lets be honest thats not me.",Barbie
10.0,Nolan's best film to date.,MOscarbradley,22 July 2023,"Like Martin Scorsese and Alfred Hitchcock before him Christopher Nolan is one of the few directors who can guarantee a paying audience as surely as any of the big box-office draws in the acting profession. A film-maker of great skill he has nevertheless often eschewed 'seriousness' to work, if not necessarily in the 'popcorn' market, then certainly in the commercial field and that's where he has built up his following. But what will his followers think of ""Oppenheimer""? Will today's movie-going generation even know who J. Robert Oppenheimer was, (at the full-house screening I attended I saw two people leave), and can Nolan do justice to his subject?To that last question the answer is undoubtedly yes. As I say Nolan is a film-maker of great skill and ""Oppenheimer"" is unquestionably his best film to date. It's an old-school epic, three hours long, superbly shot on the biggest of canvases and with an all-star cast even if some of those Oscar-winning actors are reduced to cameos, (Gary Oldman as a devious Harry Truman). At its centre there's a terrific performance from Irish actor Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer, chosen perhaps for his slight resemblance to the man but also because Nolan clearly saw in Murphy talents other of his screen roles never fully explored.Of course, in typical Nolan fashion the narrative isn't linear. The film may begin with Oppenheimer the Cambridge student and end with Oppenheimer the decorated old man but in-between Nolan skips back and forth in time, shooting both in colour and in black and white and framing his film around two sets of 'hearings', one in which Oppenheimer, late in his career, appears before a committee of three to see if his security clearance will be renewed, knowing that this is nothing more than a kangaroo court; the other, filmed in black and white, the much larger senate committee hearings set up to determine the suitability of Lewis Strauss to be U. S. Secretary of Commerce in Eisenhower's government and in this role Robert Downey Jr. Not only give the best performance of his career but should be a shoo-in for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. These scenes form the backbone of the film and may prove too talkative for Nolan's customary audience. That said, this is a beautifully composed and highly intelligent picture, clearly aimed at an adult audience. I wouldn't be at all surprised if it sweeps the boards at next year's Oscars.",Oppenheimer
6.0,Didn't quite deliver,tanner-04433,21 July 2023,"This was an exhausting movie. While Nolan shows respect to his audience by providing a challenging plot to keep up with, viewers must actively listen to all the dialogue to follow along, a task which lasts the entire 3 hours. While the music and some of the visuals are great, the characters were not likable. Their complexity was evident but somehow non of them were relatable. The plot was detailed but seemed somewhat revisionist. The communists, the Japanese, and the protagonist himself were shown to be unjustly victimized. The movie is full of tension but never quite delivers. The payoff was entirely un-atomic. I don't see myself re-watching this movie.My ears are still ringing the day after. Perhaps that was the point.",Oppenheimer

This film truly captivated me, from the very first scene until the last. I must confess that when the movie concluded, I found myself gazing at the screen, with one thought endlessly repeating in my mind: how remarkably cruel people can be. It left me craving more of this masterful masterpiece. In this movie, Nolan presents the true battle between good and evil in a dramatically captivating way.

9.0,Exactly what it should be,lmabrink-17463,19 July 2023,"Barbie was the perfect combination of light weighted fun in Barbieland with greatly timed one-liners, other clever barbie-themed aspects of barbies reality vs 'the real world' and a deep (not so hidden) meaning behind modern society, the patriarchy and feminism.There could have been so many things done wrong in this movie that Barbie did right! The casting was incredible. Even Ryan Gosling, who I beforehand thought was too old, was great and obviously well chosen for this role. Margot Robbie as the literal star of the show was of course explicitly well cast and played barbie like a second skin.There is diversity, modern issues and a whole lot of fun, the whole theater was constantly giggling and laughing. I think Barbie is a movie that really shows modern issues in a casual way and would be an eye-opener to many people (admittedly, mostly men) on how society views women in day-to-day life.",Barbie
7.0,"""BARBIE"" REVIEW",Mr-Topshotta,23 July 2023,"Directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig. A runtime of one hour and fifty-four minutes. With a PG-13 rating.Narrated throughout by Helen Mirren. Starring Margot Robbie playing the world-famous Mattel toy company character ""Barbie"", specifically ""Stereotypical Barbie"". Also starring her playmate/partner and fellow toy ""Ken"", specifically ""Beach Ken"" played by Ryan Gosling.Life in ""Barbie Land"" is magnificent. Every morning is spectacular. With ""President Barbie"" played by Issa Rae, ""Doctor Barbie played by Alexandra Shipp, and ""Physicist Barbie"" played by Margot Robbie doppelgänger Emma Mackey to name a few.With many different ""Kens"" played by John Cena, Simu Liu, Kingsley Ben-Adir who's playing ""Bob Marley in next year's biopic, and Ncuti Gatwa to name a few. Oh, and you can't forget about ""Allan"" played by Michael Cera.Every day is magical until it's not. After ""Stereotypical Barbie"" started getting some weird thoughts. She is advised by ""Weird Barbie"" played by SNL Alum Kate McKinnon to go to the real world and find her human.Not wanting to leave her side ""Beach Ken"" hitches along for the ride. But once in the real world, they will learn new harsh realities. Between ""Stereotypical Barbie"" now adult human ""Gloria"" played by America Ferrera and her teenage daughter ""Sasha"" played by Ariana Greenblatt things are far from how life is in ""Barbie Land"".With ""Beach Ken"" as well getting a heavy dose of reality. These new revelations jeopardize life in ""Barbie Land"" as a whole. It will take everyone including ""Mattel Ceo"" played by Will Ferrell to fix everything that's been forever altered.""Barbie"" from the start was said to be different. Co-Writer and director Greta Gerwig said this wasn't going to be a typical ""Barbie"" film and that the viewer will be surprised. She couldn't be more right.This film appealed to little girls and women as a whole. It was deep. It touched on emotions and feelings all women feel, have felt, or will feel at some point in their life. Many women cried while watching the film because of how hard some of the points in the film hit.It wasn't all serious. It also wasn't all pink and rainbows too. It had jokes that everyone could laugh at while also having jokes that only the older viewer would get. It made sure to not take itself too seriously but also have points to make you think. I laughed throughout the film. It was really funny.The ""Kens"" were hilarious morons. Both ""Ken"" and ""Barbie"" made fun of themselves it also had points in it that were referring to some of the stuff going on in today's climate.It was fantastically done with a lot of satire. Even the overly silly stuff made a way to make it somewhat funny. Don't judge this book by the cover you will be highly surprised. So many great actors throughout that added to the film. Ryan Gosling knew the assignment.All ages, genders, and nongenders will enjoy this film. With obvious points paying homage to women. A fun film I enjoyed way more than I thought I would. Expect a lot of different emotions with some hard-hitting realities as well. Once again I have to give a shout-out to the director/co-writer for hitting the mark. Because that's a big task to ask.This was an excellent film weekend with ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Barbie"". With their respective writer/director doing an amazing job doing both. I give this film four mor fires 🔥🔥🔥🔥 but I expect most women to rate this five mor fires. Which makes perfect sense.#CosmoandtheMovieWithin #CosmoMovieBlog #CosmoLanier #Barbie.",Barbie
6.0,Good...not great,planktonrules,29 July 2023,"""Barbie"" is a movie that is setting all sorts of records, so it's obvious that the film is touching many people. For some, it's the fun of seeing a doll come to life, for others it's the theme of empowerment that make the movie a big hit. As for me, I did like it and thought it was a pretty good movie...but it's not for everyone.The first 2/3 of the film are simply fun and a visual delight. Seeing all the Barbie's in Barbieland was a joy. It also was very nice seeing Barbie enter the real world and interact with all the unfamiliar aspects of it. As for the final third, for me, this is what hurt the film a bit...at least for some viewers. Why? Well, I loved its message of female empowerment but I also felt it was delivered like a sledgehammer. Instead of talking about it and getting on with the plot, the movie bogged down for me and seemed to keep making the same point repeatedly. Subtle, it was not. On the other hand, who am I to complain...I did like the movie and am glad it had a nice feminist bent. Obviously this worked for many women seeing the film. Overall, a very good movie that slowed to a crawl towards the end. Not bad...but a film I wanted to like more than I actually did.",Barbie
6.0,"Decent biography movie, but overrated and overhyped.",willy-65593,24 July 2023,"To be honest, i watch this movie yesterday at IMAX cinema. But find it disappointing with the bombing scene only ""just like that""? I can have better visualization in Discovery Channel or National Geographic or other in Youtube. It is to much exaggerate the Kodak 70mm feature in this movie, while 4/5 of all movie duration wasting on the discussion, court scene, and talking session. I must be honest, what for the IMAX or Kodak 70mm for this movie?And most of half duration movie is debating about he is communist of not? So tired. Whilst the bombing in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is not even seen.This movie is overrated and overhyped. It is decent biography movie, but don't exaggerate it to much.Special appreciation to Cillian Murphy who try his best to live up the character, and also for the Einstein.",Oppenheimer
7.0,I wanted to like this,guyfronte,24 July 2023,This movie was HUGE on dialog and nowhere near enough real action. Probably afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. The layer of music over top of the voice track was too much and made for too many missed words. All along I kept wishing for closed captioning so I could follow the story. For a 3 hour movie I completely expected more action. Sound decibel level was impressively loud. I expect some cinema grade loudspeakers got blown and probably startled a few Barbie movie goers in the theater next door. Time will tell if this was a hit. Might catch more streaming views so we can follow all the spoken words.,Oppenheimer
9.0,Great message and walk in history!,karlskeys-94736,20 July 2023,"We saw a pre-screening of the Barbie movie last night. I loved the walk down memory lane and some new facts about the history of Barbie scattered through the film. There were great messages around what feminism really is but also how when one gender holds all the power it's not a good balance. The actors were brilliant and Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken was just perfection. Margot Robbie made the perfect ""stereotypical"" Barbie but took us on an emotional ride of discovery. All in all it was an enjoyable movie with a great script. Great for Barbie fans and anyone who has a connection to Barbie from their childhoods!",Barbie
2.0,Not even Plastic,tcjames-74057,25 July 2023,"This film is filled with cheap cinematic and comedic tricks dying for attention and relevance. In the end, the moments are stale and require as sense of ""I guess I should laugh or chuckle a little, poor things.""The film preys solely upon the desperate desire permeating American culture for something, anything, please. (Nope still don't have anything original or high-quality in this Era of film-making).Most sequences of the film are a collection of ""unbelievable!"" instagram-like moments strung together with a lazy unity that affirms one thing: confusion.This film grossly underestimates the IQ of its audience or lacks the subtly and nuance to pursue the complex arguments regarding its central socio-political themes. It says only so much, afraid at every step to be cancelled but also trying to stand firm in some desperation for truth, to help stand up to that mean Mattel! The same Mattel that Warner Bros (who produced the Barbie film) is partnered with.Margot Robbie tries to give it her all (she can open one eye tear stream with the best of them) but her performance lacks the quiet composure of all struggling with identity issues. It is surely a barbie-rific film! Although even the fake smiles of the actors seem fake, almost as if they are saying, ""I can't believe I am doing this."" They almost solemnly predict the end of the film before a single ounce of real joy can be seen/had. The entire film is depressing, even where it is supposed to be joyful.There is no great sense of play. It appears everyone is outstandingly self-conscious and hyper aware. Weirdly hyper aware. These aren't artists (with perhaps the exception of Gosling). These are everyday men and women pretending to be actors and absurdly conscious of it. One can only get along with color palettes, explosions, and circus jokes / ""provocative"" one liners for so long. The real attempt at story was shaky at best. Amazingly studios allow Gerwig to direct a high school film project with a 150 million dollar budget and a volunteer casting call of beginning drama students and a few pretty people who always wanted to be in a movie.The long wait gets longer. When will art take a step forward? We have an American culture of business people (all greedy for more money, money, money)-very well, we lack artists!",Barbie
9.0,Your future not-so-guilty pleasure,xtbyfbz,25 July 2023,"Barbie is a really refreshing movie! Directed with a truly unique style that brings the Barbie universe to life, it tackles deep topics (gender issues, consumerism...) with a lot of humor. It opens a lot of interesting conversations in a very new way, switching perspectives to let the viewer experience the irony of the world we live in today.The only downside is that you have to close those doors, and that leads to a more cliche/expected wrap up of the story that takes away some of the uniqueness brought by the movie.Overall, a very recommended watch and a guilty pleasure for years to come!",Barbie
7.0,"Slightly underwhelming, but still a good film.",chadvanwyk,22 July 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" is a captivating character study that sheds light on the life of the esteemed physicist, J. Robert Oppenheimer, while exploring the historical backdrop of the atomic bomb. The film's unique perspective focuses on the man himself, rather than solely on the bomb's development, cleverly reflecting its title's significance.Throughout the movie, Oppenheimer's intriguing journey takes center stage, drawing viewers into the complexities of his personality and the pivotal role he played in shaping history. The story gracefully weaves together his struggles, motivations, and ethical dilemmas, making for a compelling narrative that keeps audiences engaged.While the film's emphasis on the man behind the bomb is a refreshing approach, some viewers might find it slightly underwhelming due to its occasionally bloated run time. Certain scenes could have been tightened to maintain a more consistent pace, allowing for a more impactful viewing experience.The film is filled head to toe with a talented cast that bring depth and authenticity to the characters, keeping the audience invested in Oppenheimer's personal journey. The cast, delivered compelling portrayals that truly breathed life into their characters. It's unfortunate, though, that some of the major actors seemed underutilized, leaving me yearning for more depth in their roles.In conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a movie that offers a fresh perspective on history by shining a spotlight on the enigmatic scientist. Despite its occasional pacing issues, the film's unique focus on the man himself adds depth and intrigue to an already fascinating historical period. For those interested in character-driven narratives with a touch of historical context, ""Oppenheimer"" is a worthwhile and thought-provoking watch.",Oppenheimer
3.0,Really disappointing,rachaelparker-45170,23 July 2023,"I had high expectations based off the trailer and had purchased quite a lot of merchandise in the lead up to the films release, however for me that's as good as it got, brilliant marketing. The first 20 minutes were funny and entertaining but that swiftly turns sour and boring, leading onto an hour and a half of speeches and overly serious moments that just weren't that touching. I can see what they were trying to do with #girlpower but I found it a little toxic and very much like they were trying to 'put ken back in his place' which I get is probably a metaphor for how modern day women are still treated however if you're trying to show feminism to a young audience it really needs to show actual feminism and not just toxic girl power. I would have loved for the ending to have involved an equal balance between the kens and the barbies to show what a real 'dream world' looks like. The Speeches felt very overdone and they suffocated the whole film. At least a quarter of the people in the cinema left half way through.",Barbie
10.0,Masterpiece,aalokdhonju,22 July 2023,"Absolute banger by Christopher Nolan. It's just not a movie it's a sensation, the point it tries to make about chain reaction is justified by the experience you get from watching the movie. This movie frequently touches upon the fact that now mankind truly has the power to destroy itself. From stunning visuals to real like sound effects, this movie is a masterpiece of this generation.It's a pretty loaded cast with Cillian as the lead it uses his extraordinary skills to make it feel as stunning as it can get. Robert Downey also does a great job showing how good of an actor he still is. I would recommend it to anyone who wants bang for their buck in cinemas.",Oppenheimer
9.0,"Designed for a narrow audience, with a wide blast area.",LeonvanKamp,28 July 2023,"'Oppenheimer', like the historical figure it places on center stage; is complex, cerebral, obsessed with its own brilliance, disjointed and awe inspiring.Like any great film, it shows mastery of film conventions, while challenging and pushing the boundaries. It is both entertaining and insightful. It provides moments of acting excellence through subtle drama (the quality of acting chops on display is of the highest order) and is flat out bombastic when appropriate.It is the culmination of the director's, Christopher Nolan, decades of experience, natural talent and commercial success. And yet, in my view it is not his best film ('The Prestige', just there is no ambiguity). For a simple reason, that there is no need to rewatch it (although I most certainly will).Unlike every other Nolan film, there is no effective twist, no real emotionally impactful moment of revelation, no need to piece together the subtle cues left like breadcrumbs that Nolan is such a master of.Instead this film demonstrates a deep understanding of the subject mater; quantum and atomic science, political nuance and trickery, the mechanics and embedded suspicion of the US security apparatus, and the pre and post-war political reality that the modern citizen is only vaguely aware of.But such a meticulous demonstration of the director's/screenwriters'/actors'/set and costume designers'/composer's knowledge is surely something only a handful of movie goers will truly care about.And at times comes at the expense clarity of pacing and scene transition. While at other times actually carries the momentum and convoluted plot.As such while I truly enjoyed the film and relish that this subject matter had its moment in the radiated light of the modern cinema experience, it falls just short of being a masterpiece.",Oppenheimer
8.0,"Surprises You, Entertains You",ssunny-social,24 July 2023,"One might think this is a girly movie made for teenage girls and may be the early 20s. It starts off misleading the audience into a fun filled ride of jokes and conscious silliness at the start. Later, as we all settle into the Barbie world, it slides in Feministic conversations. At one point you think whether it's an adaptation of ""Men are from Mars..."" book, because they hit you deeper than the laugh you make of the dialogue.The subtext I gather is, the film is about a rich good looking girl who is living her hunky dory life where everything is spik and span. This girl has been metaphored as the Barbie. The girl who understands little of the real world until life hits her with ugly truth (revealed at the end) and she starts feeling real pain and emotions. At first she denies it and fights it and also gets it all back for a brief moment. Later she realizes, she wants to live real and wants to let go of the made up cocoon of beauty, perfection and pink.Entertaining, fresh and perfect Sunday morning watch to setup for an interesting discussion later in the evening.",Barbie
6.0,Oppenheimer: An Overhyped Epic That Falls Short on Expectations and Overstays its Welcome,tim_d3,24 July 2023,"Tries to do too much in its three-hour run time. It should have been a much tighter 90-minute narrative.The film attempts to weave together too many stories, topics, and characters, resulting in a convoluted and cluttered narrative. The story might have been better suited to a mini-series format, similar to HBO's ""Chernobyl.""Historic characters, including prominent physicists, are portrayed in a ham-fisted, over-the-top manner that lacks authenticity.",Oppenheimer
5.0,"Funny, charming, and somewhat confused",benjaminskylerhill,21 July 2023,"Barbie is a film with undeniably gorgeous production design and distinct visual charm, and it's at its best when it embraces its surreal absurdist humor and runs with it. This has some of the funniest sequences of the year.Robbie, Gosling, and most of the rest of the cast have impeccable comedic timing. The line delivery is somehow both dry and full of energy.The world that the story presents is gleefully ridiculous and when it fully leans into this tone, it's wonderful.The problems arise when the script fluctuates wildly (and frequently) between goofy dumb comedy and heavy-handed social messaging. It's jarring and often seems to be treating us, the audience, like we're stupid.The script is so heavy-handed in presenting a shallow view of the world and reductionist view of both men and women, yet is seemingly so convinced of its intelligence and wit.A caricatured world is all good and fun, but it's not exactly conducive to making a commentary on incredibly nuanced issues.Thankfully, the film sort of figures out how to balance all of this by its final minutes, and it really does have a knockout ending.There's a lot to love here. It's just kinda messy in delivering the good stuff.",Barbie
10.0,Unimaginably great if only you can follow it the way it demands you.,screenplaytelugumovie,21 July 2023,"One of the most honestly and brilliantly made film with great performances, technical excellence & more importantly a conscious 'Love for Humanity'.Nolan has shown an unbelievable craft in filmmaking.As a teacher of Screenplay, I advice all film students and young filmmakers of India, first to go through the Notes & Reviews by critics and if possible to read whatever available on the life of Oppenheimer and then go and watch it on the biggest screen available to them.Cillian Murphy just took the 'Avatar' of Oppenheimer and so also every performer. The haunting dialogue in the film, to me, is President Truman's words ' Don't ever get that cry baby here'. A frightening one and you will see what it has done to Oppenheimer. And not to miss the conversation between Einstein & Oppenheimer. It will open your eyes and blow your minds.KL PRASAD.",Oppenheimer
4.0,Failure at igniting emotional connection,embodiedcog,22 July 2023,"At the end of the day, what is the ultimate goal of any movie? It's to present a character or a list of characters in such a way that you give a damn about what happens to them. You care about their successes and their failures. They may be the type of people that you personally have never met, or ever will, yet you still see some common human element between yourself and the character/s in question. Oppenheimer is a failure at the level of making me care about Oppenheimer the person.There were a handful of scenes where I felt I was able to appreciate the sense of moral weight and guilt Oppenheimer was feeling as the father of atomic bomb. The rest of the 3 hour movie vacillated between idolizing Oppenheimer the historical figure and going off track from the theme of the horror of nuclear weapons. Peppered in with awkward romantic subplots that only served to stymie the main plot.I used to think that romance is bad in Nolan's movies because he just didn't get romantic love. After watching this movie, I take it back. Nolan may not have a good understanding of what it means to be a human that has lived a vivacious life filled with thoughts and feelings that are forever one's own. I did not care about Oppenheimer the person going into the movie, and I still do not care about Oppenheimer the person after watching this movie.Not recommended.",Oppenheimer
7.0,"Ehhh, definitely worth trying",janaetownsend,25 July 2023,"The movie was fine honestly not my favorite. While the elements such as costumes, sets, and cinematography are amazing and done very well I think the movie is half baked. At many points I wish they would show less of something and show wayyyy more of something else. Definitely wish we saw more of the bombing. If you are someone who is into ""films"" or interested in this part of history definitely recommend watching but for just a causal viewer I personally wouldn't recommend. Also the never ended celebrity cameos sorta took me out of the illusion. Josh Peck being in the movie is so unserious. The sex scenes are not that intense but definitely a skip for young viewers.",Oppenheimer
6.0,Visually appealing but 'meh',supaculechik,23 July 2023,"Visually, it was a great movie to watch - colourful, cute and quirky. I enjoyed the first 20 - 30 minutes and then it went downhill from there. There's a lot of fantastic actors in it but I didn't go in with high expectations as I had no idea what to expect.For the story itself - sure, there were some morals and statements presented but it was a bit flat and a lot of the same. I left feeling totally underwhelmed. Gosling was great though. A few bits did make me laugh but it struggled to hold my attention. As sometimes happens, a lot of the funny parts were in the film trailers. I wouldn't watch it a second time through.",Barbie

Margot was amazing and so was Ryan gosling. 100% recommend for everyone especially if you're a father to a daughter I think it has a Good Message Emmet for all, but especially girls to be what they want to be, and how they can truly be anything. The outfits and stages were amazing. It literally looks like you were at a toy store. I will be surprised if they don't win anything for costumes. I definitely will be buying this movie when it comes out.",Barbie
8.0,Funny and Creative,mrdcarroll,27 July 2023,"The voice over commentary in some parts had me laughing to no end. Most of the Will Ferrel scenes I could have been edited out, they were too campy and distracted from the rest of the movie, fortunately they were few and resigned to the later 1/3 of the movie.To be honest I missed most of the big name actors, however Rhea Perlman was spot on perfect in her role.Margo Robbie and Ryan Gosling were excellent as well, with Ryan giving an overtop hammy performance that allowed Margo to shine as the epitome of what Barbie represents, future possibilities.Kate McKinnon was well cast and delivered flawlessly.A couple scenes were overplayed.As a moderately middle-aged man I might have laughed a little to hard in some places. It was well worth seeing, so much so that I even dressed up as 80s fashion Ken when I went.",Barbie
8.0,What a surprise!,fleyros,25 July 2023,"Go and see it with neutrality. It is not a movie exclusively for the female audience. I have fully appreciated the way in which certain topics are addressed, such as Capitalism and Patriarchy, the stereotypes of being an attractive Woman and the problem about the toxic masculinity. At the moment it is the film that most surprised me, positively, of 2023. There's a special chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie, since, when they appear together in the first scene till the last one, and when you note this detail you cannot think : ""Damn, they're so gorgeous!"".Would recommend it!!!!!!",Barbie
10.0,Masterpiece,batoulychristian-12207,22 July 2023,"What can i say that has not been already said about this movie.It's just fantastic, Cillian Murphy just kills it in every possible way. The rest of the cast was also fantastic especially Robert downey Jr and Emily Blunt.Visually it's stunning as usual since we are talking about the brilliantly of Christopher Nolan. The practical effects, the twisting storytelling with a pretty much straight storyline is another reason that makes this movie amazing.Keep in mind, this movie has a slow story full of character development and long dialogues which can be ""boring"" to some people.So if you did not like breaking bad for example and thought that it was ""boring"", most probably you will feel the same thing here. If not this would probably be one of your favorite movies (like me) Without getting into any spoilers, that was a rich experience that you will not experience it in many movies.10/10.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Unexpectedly good!,frisoflorentinus,19 July 2023,"I was be able to attend the pre premiere of this movie and I have to say this movie was unexpectetly good and this comes from a non Barbie fan. Barbie is the role Robbie was clearly born to play. Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu were incredible too and actually the whole cast of this movie shines ! Barbie is a brilliantly executed, incredibly fun, brightly colored, completely logical feminist statement that should be remembered come awards season. Ultimately, Barbie is so many things: a stereotype, a toy, an idea; a vessel of imagination; a cultural relic. But in Gerwig's trusted hands, this is Barbie like you've never seen her before.",Barbie
2.0,3 hours of my life pretty much wasted.,lamarp-37683,25 July 2023,"Actually saying I wasted 3 hours of my life is a bit harsh. This movie did hold my attention for most of the time and I only dozed off once. Perhaps if I had been more prepared and brushed up on my history, it would probably have been better. I had absolutely no idea who most of the people were or what their actual significance was, politically or otherwise. I'm a bit embarrassed that I didn't know more about them as I am 67 years old and my dad served overseas in WW2. I went to see the movie with three friends who are in their 70's and I don't believe they got much if any more out of it than I did. It was a very disappointing movie for all of us.Maybe I will read up on the people in the film and who they actually were, watch it again when it is available on streaming platforms, and may give a better rating.",Oppenheimer
7.0,"Worth seeing on the big screen. Better than Nolan's other recent stuff, but not perfect.",DJ_Reticuli,26 July 2023,"For most part, the rendition of dialogue is finally improved in this film compared to the last few Nolan outings. We're not yet back at Memento or Prestige fidelilty, though, in dialog or the rest of the film generally. Those were his seminal greats, in my opinion. Sorry, but even The Dark Knight was not a truly great film overall if you deleted Heath Ledger from it.Back to the rendition of voices, though, while most of Oppenheimer is fine, there are still a few too many scenes that are ludicrously mixed with the droning swath of the music obscuring them. There are some basic concepts in sound mixing, of keeping frequencies separated, volumes conservative for certain elements, or even panning the music to the back channels while the front is left for the voices that Nolan still refuses to adhere to enough.Combining the persistent occasional sound issues with the misuse of ADHD-style editing that Nolan first started abusing in the third act of Batman Begins, this montage-like, cutty speed where now even dramatic scenes of intimate dialogue and developing relationships are subject to this. Too much of the acting is drowned not only in the music & sound design but in this frenetic, impatient, abbreviated quality... for what, to shave 10 minutes off the total run time? Absurd. To improve the pacing and rhythm? It doesn't; exactly the opposite. It didn't work for the third act of Batman Begins' action & climax or his other films since, and certainly doesn't work for scenes of barely comprehensible dialogue in a romantic relationship. Let the performances breath, for crying out loud!It's not every scene, though, and as I previously said, there's more of Nolan's older films in this than many of his other recent films. Some segments of Oppenheimer were wonderfully edited, great sound, and the problems didn't destroy the rest of the movie for me. It's still definitely worth seeing. Heck, finally, one of my biggest pet peeves addressed: we've got a depiction of the speed of sound in film or TV. That's practically an historic moment. The Star Trek & Star Wars franchises, war films, and terrorism/spy genres take note!A few more caveats before I end this:It's too hard on Truman, who was portrayed better by Gary Sinise, anyway. Truman was duped by people around him who did not accurately & fully relay to him the prior peace overtures and terms of surrender the Japanese had offered, which required such things as their emperor remaining, which eventually were essentially accepted anyway after the detonations on two targets chosen for 1) having real humans to check the effects of the weapons on, and 2) to test on two geographically-distinct cities for future planning purposes. Truman was also not told that the Russians were positioning to assault the islands and the Japanese were desperate to surrender to the USA and not Russia. Truman later in his life admitted he'd been deceived by those around him in order to cause POTUS to make a decision his underlings wanted.The film is too easy on Teller, who had much more to do with the attack on Oppenheimer's character than is even shown here. Teller continued to have a deep connection to extremely sensitive and compartmented programs that he wanted Oppenheimer to have no connection to, and was instrumental in the assistance to the nation of Israel in the development of their thermonuclear weapons.Finally, and this is not a caveat but a defense of the film, the Hindu stuff needs to be put in proper context: life, death, pleasure, pain. The little death, as the French call it. Not to mention Hinduism did not notably become puritanical until it had to start competing with Islam in the region. In its early days, they had temples of prostitution, and the Kama Sutra is in fact a compilation of older Hindu 'holy' writings & instruction on sex.",Oppenheimer

In the theatre, I heard "" oh my god,"", sniffles, and gasps. The cast and acting was off the top and the detail was, too. Although, you may here some comments saying, "" Oh this movie is sexist against men,"". You really have to see the movie to understand it.

The plot is designed perfectly and depicts Oppenheimers life much more deeply than I suspected walking into the theatre. The cinematography was beautiful, as expected with Nolan. The music and theme was fantastic. The acting was absolutely phenomenal, and Nolan's ability to build each character deeply was crucial to the plot.

10.0,Just brilliant,mikaelafrangandonis,23 July 2023,"Having loved Cillian Murphy for his portrayal as Thomas Shelby from Peaky Blinders, I was so thrilled when I first heard he would be playing Oppenheimer. I think I first heard about it in 2021, or 2022, either way I couldn't wait to watch this movie. And I am sooo impressed with how it turned out. Though long, it kept me captivated all throughout. I didn't want to miss a minute. Excellent performances by Blunt and Downey but of course Cillian stole the show for me. What an incredible performance as Oppenheimer. I'm so glad that Cillian is finally receiving the recognition he SO DESERVES. If he had social media I'd be spamming him telling him how amazing he is lol.I truly pray he gets an Oscar for his role.

Christopher Nolan's latest and greatest masterwork is a cinematic achievement of blinding brilliance. Achieving a sublime combination of visual grandeur, technical flair, emotional intimacy and an examination of the limits of human endeavour and ambition. The tour-de-force performances are matched only by its ear-blistering musical soundscape by Ludwig Göransson, Oppenheimer is a destructive force to be reckoned with, although I'm still peeved Universal didn't let Nolan detonate an actual nuclear bomb for Trinty.",Oppenheimer

Lots of the jokes don't land but the ones that do really make you laugh. Margot Robbie gives a great performance and is going to be remembered as barbie for ever. Will Ferrell is very under utilised for such an iconic actor. There's some emotional stuff at the end and that didn't really resonate with me that much, but it might be different for other people. But the best part of this film is Ryan Gosling as Ken let alone all the Kens are great, the musical number and fight they have at the end is the absolute best part of the movie.",Barbie
7.0,Not Nolan's best. And just too long.,markgorman,21 July 2023,"When the Oscars come round I don't think it will be Cillian Murphy that gets his shoulder tapped I think it could be Emily Blunt and Robert Downie Jr who plays Oppenheimer's would be nemesis, Lewis Strauss. Don't get me wrong, Murphy is good, just not truly great.And that about sums up this overlong movie, good just not truly great.The plot wriggles and writhes through timelines in such a way as to satisfy Nolan's trademark need for complexity and I have to confess to being confused for much of its three hours.Also, if I was watching this as a Japanese viewer I'd be gritting my teeth at the overall celebration of the outcome of Oppenheimer's technical success. It treads a fine line between glorification and condemnation of the A Bomb that was dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima killing over 200,000 Japanese civilians.And while Nolan coaxes a degree of remorse out of his central character I wasn't 100% convinced that he really did regret his actions. Sure he denounces them, to an extent, but he didn't go into this in wide eyed innocence, Oppenheimer absolutely knew his objective. The ethics are pretty muddled, like a lot of the plot in my view.Ach, it's a hard one to deconstruct. I'm a little surprised at the ratings this movie is attracting because it's a long hard slog with a LOT of dialogue and not a great deal of action.Perhaps the best scenes are the test sequences in the desert, the senatorial election drama at the end and the creepy but well handled rabble rousing reception Oppenheimer receives from his team on the news that Hiroshima has been obliterated. At least in this scene Nolan convinces us that it's not a celebration of the bombing, but an indictment.Oppenheimer's vilification as a possible Communist is a central theme of the movie and is key to Strauss's objections and the 1954 kangaroo court FBI security clearance meeting which anchors the plot. There seems little evidence that he was a Commie, but the McCarthy regime at that time seemed to put little store in hard evidence and he clearly fared badly in this terrible stitch up.Perhaps my favourite moment in the movie is the look of schadenfreude on the face of Strauss's advisor towards the end of the movie.It's a delicious moment in a banquet that sadly has more plain fare than delicacies.",Oppenheimer
5.0,"Corny, Watchable, But So Corny",jonkelley-81636,23 July 2023,"This review will sorta just be a barebones review. There's no spoilers because this movie doesn't really have a plot or resolution that can be spoiled. The movie starts out with a reference from 2001: a space odyssey, Which im sure went right over the target audiences heads. Then breaks into a lot of corny jokes in Barbieland. Barbieland is the best part of the movie, the Barbies performances are all hammed up, kind of like a long progressive commercial. But the acting is supposed to be corny and overacted because they're barbies so I'll accept it. Barbieland has a lot of fun moments with the songs and dances and the beach and Cena. The design of Barbieland and costumes of the Barbies and Kens is why this movie is getting this hype ans it definitely lives up to it. Margot Robbie does a good job as barbie and Gosling as Ken is by far the funniest/best part of the movie. Barbie starts her crisis and goes to the real world and everything starts to suck. Ken finding out about patriarchy is the best thing about the real w orld. The jokes in this movie were really weak, the sentimental serious parts are really boring, this movie feels like it's 2 and 1/2 hours and it's only 1h45. Will Ferrell shows up but they forgot to write jokes for him. America Ferrera gives the most genuine performance but her character is devoid of logic and ends up just giving a long lecture. Lots of the corny jokes in this movie fall completely flat, but theres so many jokes in this movie that you will laugh at least a little bit. Men are targeted in this movie and it has no idea what subtlety is, but it is a Barbie movie so i can accept that. And most importantly this movie has no conflict resolution at all, they sorta just end the movie on one last moderately silly joke. This movie was sort of just a forgettable comedy with a lot of hype before it. But hey I'm glad it brought people to theaters again and did have a message worth watching even if it was delivered rather weakly.",Barbie
10.0,Cinematic Masterpiece that will stand the test of time,gdtfqn,22 July 2023,"Sincerely lost for words after Oppenheimer. Murphy, Damon, Blunt, Pugh, Oldman and absolutely every one else (literally everyone, be it 10 seconds screen time or 3 hours) at their absolute finest. You are captivated for every single second and feel like the film is only 1.5hrs long. I couldnt genuinely watched another hour. You're held on by every word.No CGI, just clean old fashioned cinema.So effortlessly emotive, beautifully executed and tells the story in such an informative yet fascinating way. Not a second of feeling lost or bored. Anyone could follow and everyone will absolutely love.It's been a long time since I couldn't stop thinking about a film after watching it. Please, do yourselves a favour and watch this. It really is a 10/10.",Oppenheimer
6.0,"Robbie is perfection, Gosling is 'just okay'",matt-27634,21 July 2023,"Barbie begins in a bubble-gum-coloured world of fun, fashion and perfection. Although Barbie is played by dozens of actors, 'Stereotypical Barbie' is played by Margot Robbie. Perfection in Barbie land doesn't last long though, as Barbie must travel to the real world to solve her sudden existential crisis. She meets both friends and foes along the way.As Barbie and her new girl gang return to Barbie Land, they are horrified to see that it is now renamed 'Kendom', after Ken (Ryan Gosling) who initially tagged along with Barbie has discovered the patriarchy of the real world and wants to be seen as more than 'just Ken'.With a star-studded cast full of cameos, Barbie's Margot Robbie is stunning, and I think the perfect choice for the title role. On a side note, it was nice to hear her not doing a Boston/New York accent for once. Ryan Gosling however took me out of the Ken fantasy. Character-wise he was great, but I see Ken as more of a Travis Van Winkle or Trevor Donovan type. Goslings' portrayal of Ken looked a bit sleazy, and the bleach-blonde hair did him no favours.There is a lot of lore and fun easter eggs throughout the film that both young and old can recognize, and even if you don't have a history of playing with Barbies (which I cannot confirm or deny that I did), there is a sense of nostalgia too.Bonus points for the phenomenal set and costume design, and a killer soundtrack too! I'd be disappointed if this film isn't up for any major awards for the above-mentioned.Barbie was super fun! It's also a movie that can be watched for many years to come and still seem current and relevant.#barbie #barbiethemovie.",Barbie
8.0,Excellent,DarknessVisible20,27 July 2023,"For all you attention-deficit sheep, this is NOT a BOOM-BOOM story about the bomb, it is about the life of the man who created it. And yes, it is three hours long. If this is too much for your cranial bandwidth, go watch Die Hard. Cilian Murphy did an OUTSTANDING job playing a brilliant but tortured physicist. Emily Blunt was amazing as always especially in her testimony on her husband's behalf. A well-told story that takes its time. All-star cast. Gary Oldman makes a brief but important appearance as the narcissistic psychopath war criminal Truman who called Oppenheimer a 'crybaby' for having moral conflicts about designing an instrument that murdered over a quarter of a million innocent human beings. I do wish there would have been much more of a focus on the criminal devastation inflicted upon the people of Japan. Also, deduction for the sex and nudity - WHY do movies do this? Do people enjoy watching depicted sex scenes? If so, why not more scenes of people sitting on toilets? Ridiculous and unnecessary. But all in all a great story. Murphy absolutely deserves an Oscar for this one.",Oppenheimer
9.0,A really fun time,acdc_mp3,23 July 2023,"Weeks ago I heard that there was going to be a Barbie movie coming out and my immediate first thought was ""Oh, God."" I then forgot about it and then saw the trailer for it when we went to see the new Indiana Jones movie. I always enjoy seeing Margot Robbie when I can and Ryan Gosling looked like he was going to bring some humor to the movie, so when my wife asked if I wanted to see it, I said SURE! I'm glad I did.The movie was as amusing as I hoped, and it didn't overly rely on tired story lines to make it entertaining. What it also had was a lot of heart. Margot Robbie is an actress that has a ton of sex appeal, but she doesn't use it. She uses her great skill as an actress to convey the story and does it very well.What was really fun about this movie was listening to the kids in the theater responding to it and it was pretty hilarious. My daughter and I were laughing more at that than anything. It was actually a delightful surprise that added to the whole vibe of the movie.Ryan Gosling played a goofball Ken, but he does so in a very controlled and amusing way, and you actually feel for Ken bigtime as the story moves along. He did a great job as well as the rest of the cast that made up all the Barbies and Kens.The only thing I will say takes away from this movie is Will Ferrell. I normally find him amusing in most movies he is in, but in this one, he was completely superfluous. He added not a single laugh nor important aspect to the story line. He just was not needed in this movie.So, if you have a daughter of any age, go see it with her and laugh. It's truly a good time.",Barbie
1.0,Long boring documentary,LloydChristmasss,21 July 2023,Chernobyl on Max is a thousand times better than this scam of a movie. Perfect example of false advertising. They keep it fast paced so you'll be tricked into thinking its a good movie. Probably a suggestion by the studio so audiences don't lose interest. Cillian Murphy is a great actor. That's the only positive thing i have to say about this boring garbage. All the cameos are out of place along with the sex scenes. Nolan should never be allowed to cast another movie. He got lucky with Heath Ledger. If you liked this movie then you're pretentious and a sucker. 20 year old documentaries on the subject are more interesting. If want a Nolan/atom bomb sized explosions...you'll be very disappointed. I'm depressed at the thought of Barbie probably being a better movie. I look forward to your downvotes.,Oppenheimer
10.0,"""Sublime!"" -Ken, 2023",indigobrindley,27 July 2023,"One of the most affectionately crafted and truly hilarious films of all time!Usually, a slight exhale through my nose is enough for me to classify a movie as funny but 'Barbie' had me laughing loud enough to annoy the whole cinema. It was jam-packed with line after line after line of hilarity - I couldn't even get a chance to catch my breath! Greta Gerwig's script had me snorting and crying from laughter, especially when paired with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling's flawless delivery of it.'Barbie' was full of such in-touch and specific references that the whole audience could relate to. From the Kens mansplaining 'The Godfather' to the inclusion of Weird Barbie who'd been ""played with too hard"", Gerwig made the film feel highly personal, which is quite a feat considering the impersonal nature of the subject of the movie.But it was more than just a comedy; the film touched on much deeper themes of feminism and existentialism. When Barbie left the matriarchy of Barbie Land and entered the Real World, the film acted as a political and social commentary on issues surrounding misogyny and womanhood. With Gerwig's depiction of not only what it means to be a woman, but also what it means to be human, she beautifully and skillfully brought the humanity to a plastic doll.The set design, casting, acting, writing and directing were all executed phenomenally and came together to create a poignant, multifaceted and rollicking movie. In Ken's wise words, it absolutely was ""sublime""!",Barbie
8.0,Hi Barbie!,chenp-54708,23 July 2023,"Greta Garwig is a pretty interesting filmmaker as her previous works on ""Lady Bird"" and ""Little Women"" were pretty good. Here, ""Barbie"" is really wild but I had a really fun time watching it. Throughout, the colorful pink designs, models, background, settings and structures were pretty good as it helps add the film's purposeful tone and atmosphere all together. Written by Noah Baumbach, the narrative is pretty good as it's clear the film doesn't take itself seriously and explores some pretty interesting satirical themes that worked well together with the story. All the performances were pretty good especially Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling as they have pretty great chemistry with one another. The characters were really fun to watch as it was fun to see all the Barbies, Kens, Allen, and the real world characters interact and perform on the screen.Many elements like the narrative, structures, tone, humor, and style were pretty good as Garwig's direction and Baumbach's writing helped to carry the film with some great satirical dramatic tones throughout. The soundtrack was pretty good although there were an few soundtracks choice was that were kind of bad (that Ice Spice and Nicki Minaj ""Barbie World"" was horrendous) and a few writing moments that could have been a little better.For the most part, Barbie succeeds because the film understands itself with its non-serious tone and provides a fun and bright entertainment of a film. Oppenheimer and Barbie indeed makes a great double feature.",Barbie
10.0,A Masterpiece,emresaat,30 July 2023,"Without the doubt, one of the biggest masterpieces of our time. Taking such a sensitive story, and tell it the best way possible. That's signature Christopher Nolan. Needless to say Cillian Murphy was incredibly convincing and accurate. Definitely deserves an Oscar! It is so hard to make a story that is based on historical facts, this interesting. Whole movie keeps you on the edge. Build up is phenomenal, waiting for July 16th 1945 and when it happens, it all make sense. Timeline is not linear and in my opinion this makes the story even more alluring as it leads the audience to think ""why does he feel the way he feels in the future"". Now I've become death, destroyer of worlds!",Oppenheimer
9.0,It Took a Few Days to Realize How Extraordinary It is..,evilfinal-81386,23 July 2023,"My mind was immediately blanked after the three-hour movie was done, but it wasn't confusion or any negative feelings that overwhelmed me. It was the ending scene that hit me hard, a simple yet profound conversation between two scientific greats, Albert Einstein and J. Robert Oppenheimer. Hours after the movie's conclusion, scenes flashed in my mind, and I tried to piece them together, yet I found myself grappling with an unanswered question: ""What exactly do I feel?"" The movie had left me with an indescribable sense of wonder. The following day, my thoughts remained fixated on the movie, prompting me to focus on myself instead of researching it further. In this introspection, I realized that ""Oppenheimer"" stands apart from any other movie I have experienced. It isn't driven by piquant conversations about morality or philosophy like ""12 Angry Men"" or ""Network."" Instead, it allows you to immerse yourself in the sentiments of a REAL HUMAN, whose mind is brimming with complications and contradictions. The movie's ending scene, which at first seemed simple, had become a profound catalyst for my reflections on the world.""Oppenheimer"" is an amazing cinematic experience, showcasing the brilliance of cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema. Through captivating visuals, the film skillfully conveys the full range of human emotions. Christopher Nolan's exceptional direction takes us on a remarkable journey, deftly delivering the story with finesse.The performances of all the actors, no matter how small their roles, are nothing short of exceptional. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer authentically captures the scientist's intellectual brilliance and inner conflicts. Emily Blunt, in her role as Kitty Oppenheimer, brings depth to her character, portraying a strong and supportive partner during the turbulent scientific pursuit.Particularly praiseworthy is Matt Damon's role as Leslie Groves, the general overseeing the Manhattan Project. Damon's performance exudes conviction and gravitas, adding a remarkable dimension to the movie.And now, a special mention for Robert Downey Jr., who plays Lewis Strauss in the movie. Renowned for his iconic portrayal of Tony Stark in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Downey Jr. Surprises with an exceptional performance as Strauss. He portrays a complex character with depth and conviction, showcasing his incredible talent as an actor.""Oppenheimer"" leaves a profound impact, transcending a simple historical retelling. The film delves into the intricacies of a brilliant scientist's mind, exploring the complexities and contradictions that often accompany intellectual greatness. It compels us to confront the moral dilemmas faced by those who contribute to groundbreaking scientific discoveries and the far-reaching consequences of their actions.The ending scene, featuring the poignant conversation between J. Robert Oppenheimer and Albert Einstein, resonates deeply, leaving us with a lingering contemplation of their choices and the immense responsibility that comes with knowledge.To truly appreciate ""Oppenheimer,"" avoid getting lost in the minutiae of the details. Instead, surrender yourself to its beautiful cinematography and allow the emotions the director intended to wash over you. The film presents a thought-provoking portrayal of the complexities of a human mind. As you watch, absorb the sentiment and contemplate the impact of a simple conversation between two brilliant scientists on the world's fate.""Oppenheimer"" is more than just a movie; it's a captivating experience that stays with you long after the credits roll. Christopher Nolan's visionary direction, coupled with the exceptional performances of the cast, makes ""Oppenheimer"" a must-watch film that transcends the boundaries of traditional cinema. This movie is a testament to the power of storytelling and its ability to challenge our perceptions, evoke genuine emotions, and provoke meaningful reflections on the course of human history.Additionally, I urge the audience not to overanalyze every detail, for doing so may overwhelm the senses. Instead, sit back, enjoy the beautiful cinematic journey, and immerse yourself in the emotions that the director has skillfully crafted. ""Oppenheimer"" offers a unique exploration of the human spirit and leaves us with an unanswerable question-a question that perhaps has no definitive answer. Yet, therein lies the beauty of this cinematic masterpiece.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Greta did it!,moviesbio,24 July 2023,"Greta Gerwig did it. Broke the ceiling financially for a movie directed by a woman.I like all of her work and the Barbie theme was a daring one to take on. Then again she created a powerful version of Little Women. I also figured if Isa Rae agreed to be in this, there had to be more to it.It was so much funnier than expected. They figured out how to not make a parody of Barbie and Ken. That's no small task.I don't want to give away anything because everyone is going to see themselves in this in another way. It's clever, thoughtful, and so funny. The actors performed to perfection.There's a lot to unpack in this movie. I want to watch it again. It has all the makings of a classic and a cult film.",Barbie
7.0,Better and deeper than I expected and was definitely worth a watch,kevin_robbins,21 July 2023,"Barbie (2023) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows Barbie in a perfect world who believes she is the perfect role model for little girls in the real world. When things start feeling off for her in her world, she discovers she may need to go to the real world to set things right. When she gets to the real world, she discovers how wrong she was about being the perfect role model.This movie is directed by Greta Gerwig (Little Women) and stars Margot Robbie (Suicide Squad), Issa Rae (Insecure), Kathryn McKinnon (Bombshell), Ryan Gosling (The Notebook), Alexandra Shipp (X-Men: Apocalypse) and Will Ferrell (Elf).This movie had a lot more going for it than I anticipated. The universe and characters are very well developed, thoroughly put together with the history of the Barbie universe incorporated and a smart scripts. The dialogue and interactions were much deeper than I anticipated. There were a lot of good messages and lessons baked into the storyline. My only complaint was how much focus there was on the ""Ken's."" He was a worthwhile villain, but the ending dance scene and finding self moment was overdone; however, everything about the Barbie plot hit the nail on the head.Overall, this is better and deeper than I expected and was definitely worth a watch. I would score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend it.",Barbie
10.0,"Goofy, girly, and gorgeous",aivilovee,25 July 2023,"I knew going into Barbie that I was in for a visual feast. The trailers showcased the wonderful set design, costumes, and performances already. But I was not expecting how affecting this movie would be.Greta Gerwig proves for yet a third time that women's stories are worth telling with Barbie. Only she could look at the plastic empire and find a story about what it means to be a woman in a society that hates them. What's miraculous is she does this all while also proving that men still suffer in an unequal society as well. It's such a careful examination of the culture we live in, but it's also absolutely hysterical and includes some of the hardest laughs I've had at the movies all year.I know Greta's next project is a massive IP blockbuster, and while some might be worried that she's selling out, I'm not. She'll find new meaning to add in whatever she does.",Barbie
5.0,Feminism but the rest?,iyaseminkose,23 July 2023,"I'm NOT a Barbie girl in NOT the Barbie World, Life in plastic, It's NOT fantastic. In the beginning of the film, it can be thought that will go nice way with a good end and a powerful message. There is so much effort in the beginning, like building a strong idea, however this is disappered in the final. And this is such a disappointment that the film does nothing about giving an idea about liberal feminism because there is always managers as boys or girls. I think the film's main idea should be every human being no matter it is a boy or a girl can be everything they want and can be handle every situation as a human. It is ridiculous to discuss this as ""being a man or a woman"" in the 2023. In the Barbie world or in the real world it should be out of date. The final should be reviewed with this manner cause the expactation was very high with this huge-budget film...",Barbie

Christopher Nolan did an amazing job directing Oppenheimer. The way he tells the story of doctor Robert was fantastic, they were able to make everyone in the theater so excited throughout the movie which is mainly focusing on politics without any action scenes and that's really incredible.

9.0,unexpectedly profound,marcoarbia,21 July 2023,"Thought i was in for a witty, sugar coat covered comedy in which i would have sang the praises of Robbie, Gosling and the production design team. And while that for sure happened, i also found an unexpectedly deep movie, one that even if maybe at times is a bit redundant with its expression of theme, always find an original way to convey it, and really goes some unexpected places emotionally. Truly special, at times laugh-out-loud funny, and in a couple of instances surprisingly moving. The direction is focused, Gosling's comedic timing is impeccable, Robbie's bravura shines throughout, the soundtrack is one smash hit after the other, and yes, omg, the sets are truly amazing.",Barbie

Could a child watch this for the sake of it purely being Barbie? Yes. Could an adult enjoy this and understand the true meanings of the film? Yes!Without giving any spoilers away Greta Gerwig delivers a fun filled adventure with mature enough themes to open the eyes of many film goers to see what is really out there happening in todays world and this a pure reflection of that formatted in a way that all can enjoy.A seemingly fully invested enable cast bring the life and soul to this film, Gosling seemingly carrying this film on his back and Margot's performance was also good enough.The cinematography and stage design for this was exactly how you would imagine and provide a great backdrop to this film, The musical numbers and art style were in complete sync boosting the film to wild heights.Some tough, touching and some frankly weird scenes (The very end) left me feeling great overall and its certainly a film I would see again and one I would recommend.",Barbie

The story was very well timed and payed out with the development of all of the characters and their relationships with each other.Before this movie I did not know anything about the man who the movie is named after but, now after seeing it I am drawn to conduct some research on him and his work from that time period. Chris Nolan's does an incredible job unrolling and unfolding the plot and twists without allowing his audience to know or expect what's coming next.

10.0,A hand-crafted ball of serotonin,jacksongaming-80094,21 July 2023,"Prepare to embark on a mesmerizing journey through the enchanting world of Barbie! This handcrafted ball of serotonin is an absolute delight, leaving your heart brimming with joy from start to finish. Trust me, my cheeks were hurting too, but it was a small price to pay for the unbridled happiness that ensued.In the magical realm of Barbieland, Oscar-worthy set designs work like portals, whisking you away to a realm of imagination and wonder. The chemistry between Margot and Ryan is nothing short of spectacular, radiating an irresistible charm that leaps off the screen and captures your heart.Beyond the surface, the film's plot weaves a tapestry of surprises, defying predictability with cunning twists that keep you guessing throughout. Amid the laughter, ""Barbie"" serves as a brilliant mirror, reflecting upon society's norms, dismantling stereotypes, and fearlessly confronting issues of gender inequality and toxic masculinity. Such clever social commentary adds depth and meaning to this seemingly carefree adventure.As for the comedy, prepare for a sidesplitting experience! Joke after joke lands perfectly, leaving you in stitches and gasping for breath. However, the true comedic gem is none other than Will Ferrel, who delivers a performance that leaves a lasting impression. With impeccable timing and wit, he steals the spotlight in every scene, creating comedic gold that will resonate with audiences of all ages.While the movie does wear the hat of a toy advertisement, it walks the tightrope adeptly. Balancing appeal to the younger audience with engaging entertainment for adults, ""Barbie"" strikes a perfect harmony that caters to both ends of the spectrum.With all the praise deservedly sung, there is only one minor drawback - the movie ends too soon! As the credits roll, you'll find yourself yearning for more of this delightful and captivating experience, a testament to the film's greatness.",Barbie

I loved each character and the message sent is very powerful and I'm glad for it.

4.0,"Not the evil propaganda some people are saying, but also not funny and very shallow",Metal_Robots,22 July 2023,"I just watched Barbie, it wasn't offensively bad. It was just weak, and not funny. The feminist rant stuff is unapologetically there, not as frequent as some people are saying, it came across to me like content from an '80s female stand up comedienne, so nothing original, and very dated. The script is messy and doesn't make a lot of sense even regarding it's own internal logic.The ""empowerment"" stuff in it is very generic, a lot of the sentiment is kid's film-level ""just be yourself and like yourself"" thinking that applies to any person, but it's only the girls in the film that make these profound ""revelations"" as they are the creative gender and the guys (in Barbie land and the ""real"" world) are all cardboard cut-out airheads.The film is nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is, it's pretty shallow and light-weight and isn't going to leave lasting impact in pop culture, good or bad, pretty forgettable really. Kids of an impressionable age will most likely just be bored by it, and most older people will see it for the weak sauce it is.",Barbie

I was not sure what to expect but it exceeded anything I could have imagined. While there was an inherently difficult topic at the core, it was handled delicately and with care. Lots of hilarity for the adults but minimal issues that would create discomfort if you take younger kids. My kids have already said they want to watch it again.

In the beginning she was fun (my favorite was one of the mermaid Barbies), but growing up I distanced myself from the pink toy. It was no surprise I wasn't excited about the movie until I heard Greta was involved.This movie is exactly what I would want from a Barbie movie. It's extremely campy throughout, but also recognizes that life is very much complicated. It's not easy being an adult woman or man. Do you want to laugh? Watch this movie. Do want to feel seen and have one of those cathartic cries? Then go and watch this movie!",Barbie
10.0,One of the best Biographical movies of all time!!!,sagartiptur,26 July 2023,"I watched this movie both in English and Hindi languages,and no doubt this could become one of the highest grossing R rated movies.Positives of the movie is Christopher Nolan's screenplay,direction, performances of the lead cast and soundtrack. These type of movies would easily become slow paced and dull,what makes this movie interesting is fast paced editing, brilliantly crafted non linear story telling.It's true that this movie is not for everyone, but everyone is on for watching it.

The way that it perfectly describes how it is to grow up as a woman and lose your girlhood, while the weight of society comes down at you all at once is insane. Margot Robbie was quite literally the most perfect choice for this movie and I have never had such a sinking feeling in my chest while also loving a movie so so so much. The one problem is that it is so catered to women that the men watching literally just don't understand. The point of the movie, at least what I think is the point, is to show how women are still being put underneath men, but these men watching wont get the same reaction women do. They wont understand how true this movie is and how in a world full of Ken's, they should be an Allan.",Barbie
3.0,Call it 'Nolan' rather than 'Oppenheimer' can make the rating higher,timiark,22 July 2023,"Given a pan of spagetti, you can cook it in different ways, boil it, BBQ it, steam it, anyway you want, but it won't turn out more. You can also cut it to make more pieces, but you still cannot make more out of it.Same for the movie. I don't know why it is rated this high.1. Funny cutting that constantly switches between timelines. And once you think it through you will find it unncessary and too showy.2. Too much conversation happening in short durations in different timelines. Confuses people and hardly get to the point.3. Too many characters popping out in short duration that you cannot even name them when the film is finally finished. Audiences are just struggling with how one character related to another.4. Nolan, starting from TENET, is heading to a strange direction that he makes film not for the audience but for gimmicks.Surely and admittedly, the casting is perfect, acting is perfect, filiming is perfect, everything is perfect except how the story is told, the core of the film, is just oridinary and intentionally scattered all over the place during the 3hrs duration of the movie.You can say that my taste of movie is not good, but I bet you most people walking out of the cinema are just as confused as me because they are already forgetting what happened in the first hour when those last few scenes are coming. Then, when they are home, when they click a youtube video explaining what on earth actually happened, they will just find out: ok, this Nolan guy is just making things complicated because he wants to make things complicated.Will people get Oscar because of this film? Yes, I think so. But, this does not make it any more better than a intentionally complicated film. I just hope more people that watched the movie can be brave enough to write down their actual feelings. I originally rated 5, but after seeing those 10/10 reviews, it is 3 now. I cannot get through why people are praising its weaknesses over and over again. It's Nolan, so what? If a film cannot get to general audience, how can it be the 'best' film?",Oppenheimer
9.0,Not as expected,oliwest,24 July 2023,"A great film that shows both the hardship of real life and the beauty of life. Great film and unexpected .I would highly recommend for any viewer , I felt the corny dancing and the meaningful actions made for a great cocktail.I went with a mixed group of different ages and everyone enjoyed the film. Some found it meaningful and some found it comedic and slapstick.The cast was one hundred percent perfect and I can't imagine a different Ken or Barbie. Ryan gosling played his part superbly and you could at times relate to his character and other times laugh at his mid fortune and dance routines.Overall a great film.",Barbie
6.0,No. Behave. it's a complete action less slog.,dyingrepublicofpanama,27 July 2023,I'm a decent lover of history and knew this would be a slog. It was. Enjoyable for me cos I was into it. But 3 hours of pure torture for anyone who isn't.Great performances from cillian and Robert but no. This is not a summer blockbusterUnable to recommend to a cinema goer.Nolan misses twice with as many films and his star is on the burnout. Gravity has taken over and it looks after tenet and this it's a black hole.Not an enjoyable experience sitting there for 3 hours and questioning why he chose to attempt this story. Wasn't a good time.Dunkirk and interstellar make me want to go to day one release of a nolan film.This and tenet. No.I won't rush back for his next. If you don't like history or courtroom dramas. Avoid.,Oppenheimer
9.0,A thoughtful blockbuster,david_jinkins,23 July 2023,"Last year I was appointed to a department hiring committee for an important position. When a colleague asked me who else was on the committee, she scoffed at the gender composition. Even though our department is half women, the hiring committee was nearly all men. I hadn't noticed until she mentioned it. What else don't I notice?According to the philosopher Richard Rorty, art is better at changing minds than argument, because it allows the audience to see through someone else's eyes and empathize. In the Barbie movie, shortly after he arrives in the real world, Ken takes a walk through Century City in Los Angeles. Among the skyscrapers there are men in business suits, and a guy exiting a gym nods at him. A couple of guys jump out of a hummer, and policemen ride by on horses. A woman assistant is shushed by businessmen in important discussion. Finally there is a montage of men -- US presidents, movie stars, sports stars, stock traders, Mount Rushmore, and the portraits on US currency. Ken realizes that, unlike in Barbie's world, men hold the power in the real world. Ken learns to sing the 1996 Matchbox 20 hit Push, featuring the lyrics, ""I want to push your around, and I will, and I will."" When the song came out, it was my freshman year in high school. I must have heard it hundreds of times, but I never noticed that the lyrics hinted at violence against the singer's love interest. The film made me notice specific parts of American culture which I had absorbed growing up without thinking, and which reinforced the idea that men have the power in society.The film will work best for an American audience. Not only would it had hit less hard if I hadn't been forced to reevaluate the messages underlying parts of the culture I grew up with, but another wonderful aspect of the film was its send-ups of American films and popular music. The opening to 2001 is ported into the wonderful first minutes of the film. A bit later, a character makes Barbie choose between continuing her fantasy life (represented by a stilleto) and learning the truth (a birkenstock sandel). There is a great musical tribute to Take on Me (I know, a-ha is Norwegian, but it was a US hit!), and a power ballad that reminded me of Free Bird. Later in the film, Ken wears a faux mink coat that I'm sure I've seen on Logan Paul. I must have missed many more.It is surprising that Mattel signed off on the film, since it does a good job of presenting the good, the bad, and the weird of Barbie over the years. While she started out in a swimsuit, Barbies were sold in the getup of just about every profession. Girls could play with Barbie the surgeon, Barbie the scientist, or Barbie the politician, and maybe imagine themselves in those traditionally male roles. On the other hand, a teenage character points out that Barbie has given unrealistic body and beauty ideals to generations of women, and that Barbie promotes unhealthy consumer culture with all of her outfits and accessories. If nothing else, the color profile of Barbie is pink and glittery. The weird are all the discontinued barbies -- including ""Growing Up Skipper"", a doll with inflatable breasts.I nicked one star because of the constant product placement and the milquetoast feel-good ending. That said, the movie is worth your time. After years of copy-paste superhero movies and CGI spectacles, the Barbie movie gives me hope for a future of more thoughtful Hollywood blockbusters.",Barbie
7.0,The Kenergy was Kenough for me.,khalidmoubile,22 July 2023,"Barbie.Barbie suffers a crisis that leads her to question her world and her existence.I've just watched Barbie and here me out, I was aware of what I'm going to receive, it was exactly what I thought!Barbie is a fun light movie that you can't take that serious in it's big picture , you just enjoy the colors, the dynamic and the concept in general... The plot was kind of interesting, it makes you attached to the movie, the characters were silly but in a mostly funny way, it really had its funny moments especially with Ryan Gosling as Ken he was hilarious, I liked what he did here and Margot fits perfectly no need to say more about her.The only thing that made me uncomfortable is that they were trying to send messages through this film, it's not about the manner but the quantity, a dozen of them if I'm not afraid but it wasn't that forced to be fair.Enjoy it, the Kenergy was Kenough for me!",Barbie
6.0,It was great but...,helenahansn,24 July 2023,I like the overall feeling of the movie. It was created so beautifully and with such care and creativity and love for the Barbie universe It was also so silly and fun.But it was alot and honstly a bit too long.It was saying alot of what felt like important things but somehow it felt flat.Maybe i just like a movie that just is a movie.Though it is so understandalbe that in that Barbie universe they like to explore and acknowledge those huge subjects such as gender equality. In that veiw the small problem i have is they may have tried to hard and the story got lost a bit.In the light of all that Someway somehow it becomes though fun a bit of an forgettable experience.Ps. Tiny Spolier: What about the kens. There story made me feel Abit sad and I wanted a happier ending for them.,Barbie
6.0,Could Have Been Great. 2nd Half Brings It Down.,Revuer223,23 July 2023,"The quality, the humor, and the writing of the movie is fun for a while. It's quirky and it's unique. When they get into the weeds and try to explore deeper themes, the movie is a miss. The middle expositional phase of the movie, I must say, is a bore.The movie was so close to being great, but it was incapable of delivering a message without having a character literally give a speech worth of dialogue.What could have been a great satire and what began as a cleverly funny movie turned into a preachy and moralizing movie in the end. But I guess the charm of the first half of the movie made up for the shortcomings.",Barbie
5.0,"Preachy, vapid, and disappointing",harrymego,23 July 2023,"I went in with my sister who grew up watching animated Barbie movies since she was a kid like ""Barbie: Princess Charm School"" or ""Barbie: Princess and the Popstar"" or ""Barbie: Rapunzel,"" etc. I was excited, but more for her, because I know how much Barbie means to her. But sadly, she and I were very disappointed.Like to my sister, Barbie means something to girls everywhere, teaching the important and necessary values aimed at women, and giving them a role model to look up to. But after seeing this movie I can't tell you what Barbie stands for.In ""Barbie"" Margot Robbie's character is called a ""fascist"" and a terribly unrealistic image of a perfect woman. Ken is emasculated, fed sexist stereotypes and turned into a joke. The rest of the other Barbies are manipulative and standard feminist archetypes.I'm not political, but there's an obvious message the writers are pushing here. And it's not subtle at all. Men are worthless and Barbie's unique femininity is problematic.The best thing about the film is its wonderful costume design and special effects. But sadly, that's about it for ""Barbie.""",Barbie
2.0,Not for me.,truthisuncouth,21 July 2023,"I was thinking that Barbie was going to be a light hearted family movie.....it is not. You don't want to take the kids to this movie. I mean that was probably obvious from the trailer, casting and vibe. But if you were looking for a fun movie to take you away from the everyday heaviness...this is not that movie. If you want eye candy and lots of posturing and narrative sequences, then this movie is for you....otherwise I'd say don't go. Greta Gerwigs third directorial outing could have been so much more....sadly it does not live up to the hype. I just don't understand why they can't seem to make enjoyable movies that transport you away anymore.",Barbie
10.0,Best movie ever,cadylily,21 July 2023,"This movie is the definition of camp and fun cinema that also makes you think. I don't think I've ever laughed as much and for so long as I did when I was in the theater watching this movie. This movie is one of them where before you've even finished watching it the first time around you know you are gonna be coming back to watch it again and again. I remember watching all of the trailers and teasers and being so excited for this movie but also scared, because this could have either be the greatest movie ever or the worst movie ever. And of course it was the greatest movie ever. I highly recommend to anyone who wants to just have fun and laugh for the 2-hour run time (that flew by super quick).",Barbie
10.0,Such a fun time for people not stuck in the 1950's,cristorey,20 July 2023,"Barbie is such a fun time, the whole cast collectively deserve an award. Contrary to what some people are already claiming, this is not a men hating film, it is so much nuanced than that. In fact, by the film's conclusion it is clearly demonstrated why extremes wouldn't work, we all need each other and we need to learn how to coexist. I'm so glad this film had something to say. I can tell a certain faction of pea-brained individuals are absolutely gonna seethe when they see this film, and that just make me love it even more.

10.0,Oppenheimer is a breathtaking masterpiece.,salamontamas,26 July 2023,"Movie skillfully combines the elements of action, audio, acting, direction, and scene design into an unforgettable cinematic experience.This historical drama, directed by the brilliant Christopher Nolan, weaves a mesmerizing narrative that delves deep into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the brilliant physicist whose work changed the course of history during World War II.From the moment the film begins, the audience is transported back in time to the tumultuous era of the 1940s, and Nolan's impeccable attention to detail immerses us into the historical setting effortlessly. The cinematography is awe-inspiring, and the breathtaking landscapes blend seamlessly with the authentic period settings, bringing Oppenheimer's world to life.Each actor brings depth and authenticity to their characters. Cillian Murphy shines in the lead role, delivering a captivating portrayal of a conflicted hero torn between duty and personal struggles. The supporting cast, including Robert Downey Jr. And Emily Blunt and Matt Damon and others, deliver standout performances that contribute to the emotional resonance of the narrative. The chemistry among the cast members is palpable, adding further layers to the film's storytelling.Christopher Nolan's direction is, without a doubt, a work of art. His ability to interweave historical events with human emotions and philosophical musings is nothing short of genius. He masterfully guides the audience through a rollercoaster of emotions, leaving us contemplating the consequences of our actions long after the credits roll.It is an absolute must-watch for cinema enthusiasts and an enduring testament to Nolan's lasting impact on the world of film.",Oppenheimer

Every after the seeing the trailers the movie was so much more weird and wonderful and pink than I'd even imagined. I laughed so hard. There is also a sweet message about the pressures of life and society and gender roles without being preachy. It feels like a message of kindness to ourselves and to others. I now know that I am Kenough.The writing of this film was brilliant. It could have been a strange and tacky film; but instead it reminded us of the endless possibilities of stories and imaginations. The music, costumes, sets and actors all were the perfect pink sprinkles on top.",Barbie
10.0,Like witnessing classical music from the greats !,khanrulz69,25 July 2023,"Now I don't mean to say that the Marvel movies or the Flash/Mission Impossible/ Indiana Jones aren't any good -despite their criticisms they serve their purpose as entertainment . But every once in a while there comes a film like Oppenheimer and you see exactly what Scorsese meant when he referred to these films like amusement parks . They're fun but largely forgettableOppenheimer is the complete opposite - miles and miles ahead of anything that these films could hope to achieve . Every now and then during the movie a part of my mind as an avid movie goer kept saying that this witnessing film history in the making . I was reminded of Scorseses quote that despite a lifetime of watching film we've just seen what cinema could doIn its 3 hour run time there isn't a single frame wasted or.a single character that feels wasted. The acting roster feels like you're seeing the Classic XI coming out to play . The right combination of popularity and acting prowessI was very happy to see Jason Clarke , Matthew Modine and even Gary Oldman in this .Robert Downey Jr. Once again proves why he's a living legend and shows us fully the man beyond Iron ManAnd as for the man himself - I have no doubts that Cillian Murphy is going to walk away with dozens of nominations and is the first serious contender for this years Best Actor Oscar . A lot of us film nerds have been rooting for him for a long time and were happy to see the man's stellar turn as the iconic Thomas Shelby and now with his portrayal of Oppie he takes that bar of excellence even further. I was reminded of the intensity of classic golden age Hollywood actors time and time againVery few directors have made me feel strongly about cinema- Stanley Kubrick , Martin Scorsese , Paul Thomas Anderson and NolanWatching this film is like witnessing a live rendition of a classic musical piece by Mozart ir Beethoven.",Oppenheimer

Ryan Gosling gives an Oscar-worthy performance and has a true rock 'n' roll voice. The soundtrack is also very, very good. Subjects of patriarchy and cultural hegemony are approached with humour and historical references. Michael Cera is funnily adorable. Barbie is funny and surprisingly entertaining.

The movie is so well made and everything is very enjoyable, the emotions of the actors and everything was on point. Murphy did a wonderful job but lets not forget about Downey jr. And Jason Clarke who gave such intense emotions which made me very curious about what will happend next. The fx were incredible and everything seemed so realistic you could'nt tell if it was real or computer made. I encourage watching it on a 70 mm imax for the best experience but even a simple cinema will get the standards high. Congrats to Christian Nolan and to everyone from the production.",Oppenheimer
10.0,These things are heavy on the heart..,balintkinga,24 July 2023,"""Why do people go to the cinema? What takes them into a darkened room where, for two hours, they watch the play of shadows on a sheet? The search for entertainment? The need for a kind of drug? All over the world there are, indeed, entertainment firms and organisations which exploit cinema and television and spectacles of many other kinds. Our starting-point, however, should not be there, but in the essential principles of cinema, which have to do with the human need to master and know the world. I think that what a person normally goes to the cinema for is time: for time lost or spent or not yet had. He goes there for living experience; for cinema, like no art, widens, enhances, and concentrates a person's experience-and not only enhances it but makes it longer, significantly longer.""Andrei TarkovskyI came across this quote wright before entering the cinema to watch Oppenheimer and it sums up pretty much the essence of what I experienced watching this masterpiece, calling it a movie seems to not be enough.It's history, it's science, it;s engineering, it's art, it's psychology, it's a cinematographic matesterpiece, it's human, it's touching and it's terrifying.",Oppenheimer

3.0,Well done but I just can't enjoy it.,MovieNinjaGuy,22 July 2023,"Great acting, extremely well made and constantly questions about the dangers of inventing nuclear weapons as you would expect.However, it's mostly talking, name dropping, politics and becomes very boring to me as a result. It is also very disjointed, constantly jumping between timelines and locations.Weirdly the exact thing I wanted to see (how the bomb was made and what Oppenheimer contributed) is not addressed so much!Christopher Nolan apparently doesn't use much ADR and it might be the reason the dialogue mix has been pretty poor in most of his recent movies. When there IS so much talking this becomes quite a chore to have to put up with I have to say, especially for 3 hours. Swelling of sounds and music when people are talking is just irritating. I know this is done for dramatic effect at times but it's just annoying.There is very little footage outside of court rooms and offices in this movie, thus I don't see the hype for Imax at all, but Nolan is able to achieve this exact thing for some reason. However I think he is living of past glory here with the awesome Dark Knight setpieces which were great in that format.Just not a movie for me at all. I love Nolan's Batman movies but everything else he does is just a type of cinema I can't really enjoy.I'm glad others have a better experience with his movies.Your mileage may thus vary.",Oppenheimer

Ryan Gosling's Ken is everything, and he's absolutely perfect. This entire movie is perfect. I don't want to say too much and spoil anything for those that haven't seen it yet, so just go ahead and do yourself a favor and go see it. What are you waiting for? P. S.

8.0,Exceeded my expectations!,leonardocedi,22 July 2023,"I just saw the barbie movie this day and in a few words I can say that it exceeded my expectations that I had about this movie.First of all, the performance of all the characters in general is more than decent, and I also feel that it had a perfectly planned plot, since I consider that no scene is out of context or just filler, which is something that happens very often in movies these days.Also another aspect to highlight is that the film in general is still entertaining for audiences of all ages, since it contains humorous phrases and references that make the film more attractive to people.Finally, the main reason why I liked this film so much was that it leaves you with a very deep message, since this film touches on very sensitive issues that represent the defects of the human being, and this film leaves us a message that we are all equally important and that we must not let ourselves be carried away by society's stereotypes.",Barbie
3.0,"Boring, there's nothing more i can say.",bartdereu-167-366044,22 July 2023,"I went to this movie with maybe too high expectations. I loved Nolan's work so far, with Interstellar as my all time favorite movie. Seeing the ratings and read the user reviews i really thought this couldn't go wrong.Nothing seems to be the case. I've seen it last night and all morning i am wondering where the high ratings come from. I have watched a documentary for 3 long long hours, without any excitement . The bomb explosion scene was the only good thing in this movie, all the rest is plain boring chatter with 4 different storylines running trough each other. Nolan added a black and white storyline because he must have realized that most of the people otherwise wouldn't get anything of the movie at all.I really hate to say it : Don't waste your time to go see it. You're warned.",Oppenheimer
4.0,Uncomfortable watch,giang-taquynh,23 July 2023,"The most political movie I have ever watched. It is so confusing that you can't be sure what its target audience is.

As a woman, I honestly felt quite uncomfortable seeing how all the men in the movie were portrayed as stupid and shallow human beings.Overall, 4/10 for good acting, good music, and good costumes.I went to watch this movie as I heard it is not just an easy going entertaining one like everybody was expecting but touching and deep.

1.0,"Super Cringe, Poor script",aizaz-78527,23 July 2023,"Barbie: A Rollercoaster of EmotionsIn the vast cinematic universe, every now and then we stumble upon movies that leave us perplexed. The recent entrant to this league is the film ""Barbie."" Now, while one might naturally expect whimsical magic, tales of transformation, or inspirational stories from a Barbie-themed narrative, this movie takes an entirely different turn.The film starts with a ""wow"" moment, and by that, I mean it does capture attention. Vibrant colors, meticulous animation, and that pristine, Barbie-esque world build an immediate intrigue. It's almost as if you're handed a glossy magazine and can't wait to flip through the pages.Soon enough, laughter echoes, thanks to a series of light-hearted and sometimes slapstick comedic scenes. ""Hahahaha,"" goes the audience, and you find yourself laughing along. The humor is akin to what you'd find in classic cartoons where situations spiral out of control in the most unpredictable manner. But then, unpredictability isn't a constant in this movie, as we soon discover.As the plot progresses, the jokes transition from being genuinely funny to being cringe-worthy. One cannot help but feel that the writers might have been trying a tad bit too hard to maintain the film's comedic momentum. The dialogue, the character interactions, the situations - everything starts to reek of cliches that most of us have outgrown. It's akin to that feeling when someone stretches a joke far beyond its elastic limit - it snaps.""Super cringe"" is an apt descriptor for the midpoint of the movie. It's as though the film decided to try on every trope in the book. At this juncture, I found myself torn between wanting to continue watching out of sheer curiosity or to flee and save myself further second-hand embarrassment. It's the cinematic equivalent of a car crash - you can't help but watch, even if through the gaps in your fingers.The descent into ""ewww"" territory is swift. The choices made by characters, the overdone scenes, and some seemingly unnecessary dramatic moments make one question the very essence of the storyline. Is this still a Barbie movie or a parody of itself?Just when you're on the brink of giving up, the movie surprises with a ""serious speech."" This soliloquy feels out of place, like an oasis in a desert. The emotional weight behind the words and the depth it brings is commendable. It's as if the movie momentarily redeems itself, reminding us of the values and the principles that Barbie, as a brand, has stood for over the years.But before one can dwell on this profound moment, the movie hurries towards ""the end."" The conclusion, or lack thereof, is a testament to the film's erratic narrative journey. It's disjointed, abrupt, and leaves more questions than answers.In summation, ""Barbie"" is predictably unpredictable. From the promising start to the descent into a muddled mess, the movie is an enigma. The storyline's trajectory is confusing, and it's evident that there was a lack of clear direction in what the writer was trying to convey. The film lacks a proper ending and leaves viewers in a lurch, desperately trying to piece together the filmmaker's intent.For ardent Barbie fans, this might be a disappointment. For those looking for something unconventional (albeit chaotically so), it might be worth a watch. One thing is certain, though: this film is bound to spark conversations, be it about its brilliance or its sheer audacity. But as the age-old adage goes - any publicity is good publicity. And ""Barbie"" sure has got everyone talking.",Barbie

It's summer but it feels like autumn here in London. I went home and drank a lot of vodka. It helped me pick my head off the floor. Something felt terrible, or maybe terribly unusual, inside me and I couldn't figure out what. How did a movie MOVE me like this? Only real death has shaken me like this before.

The story upon which it is based is really interesting as well. The adaptation for the screen, however is blatantly somniferous. Taken into account the upward trend of magnificence in each consecutive Nolan film, this is an absolue low point. It contains the usual tricks: black and white different time lines; flashbacks to a happening undisclosed until the end; ticking tacking music; silence before complete blasting of your eardrums. But now with an A24 vibe... I can't imagine this film has lived up to anybody's expectations.",Oppenheimer

2.0,So political and weird humor,rayannacape,23 July 2023,"This film had so much to yet fell so flat.First off, the humor felt so cheesy and dumb. It didnt fit well together and often (mostly) missed the mark. It started weird, got better then NOPE! Flat. Over and over again.The flow of the plot, also, had so many great things yet was carried out in such a strange flow. Started great then strange, goes great then strange, etc., on and on again.Yet, the thing that truly sucked was the ultra feminism-> It made all men weak and stupid, and that is just wrong. Women are strong and powerful, but men do not need to be so degraded to see it. Women shine on our own. Masculinity is great, and WOMEN are great. Together they are wonderful. Woman are strong, and men aren't the problem. Hate and being a jerk is the problem.But, the good- the relationship between Barbie and Gloria! It was so sweet. Still ultra feminist but so so sweet.AND WEIRD BARBIE is awesome. She's so weird and every girl ever loved their weird Barbie. I sure did.",Barbie
10.0,Unforgettable. A work of genius.,LeAvantGuardian,26 July 2023,"Oppenheimer is by no small margin the most profound movie I've ever seen. It is no exaggeration to say that this film is a work of genius. Not just on part of the directing and screenplay, but interestingly enough, the editing. In a 3-hour movie, there wasn't a single wasted frame. The editing and sound design played such pivotal roles in the film in adding layers of depth beyond even the script and dialogue. I never thought I'd see a movie that has quite literally no action whatsoever but never-the-less never a dull moment. Every scene is pertinent, every line explosive and powerful. Featuring one of the most star-studded casts I've ever seen (I recognized every actor in the movie) giving the performances of their lifetimes, I strongly suspect everyone from the director, editor, writer, composer to the majority of the cast will receive tons of well-deserved accolades for this feature. I went in expecting it to be very good and very powerful. I came out experiencing a masterpiece of cinema, one I'm likely never to forget.",Oppenheimer
7.0,Somehow... It worked!,mfabianovaa,26 July 2023,"Not just the intro, but the whole movie is funny and smart as hell. You are griped by the voice of Helen Mirren, interactive singing by Liso and a strong focus on humor. The details in Barbieland are hilarious. There is no water in the shower or glasses, the pool is a decoration, every night is a girl's night. It shows you how great imagination is, especially kids imagination. And it guides you to perceive the movie with an open mind. After Barbie and Ken enter the real world, it can be even more unhinged and crazy than Barbieland. What helps you to just go with it, is that this 'real world' is also shown as fiction, in details. The all the way up button in the elevator, the immediate response of the director of Mattel, that they had to get Barbie in the box, meeting the ghost of an old lady. It really helps you to let that absurd concept entertain you on every level. So you laugh a lot, cry a bit, feel motivated and you hope that everyone is truly listening to the message to love yourself.",Barbie
2.0,Barbie - Unspeakably Bad,jonathanruano,21 July 2023,"I am not surprised in the least that the Barbie movie is trash and a truly deplorable career choice by Margot Robbie who will probably be type cast forever in Barbie-type roles.To begin with, there is just too much pink and superficiality for this movie to inspire anything more than groans and watching your watch waiting for the whole travesty to be over. The plot is completely by the numbers as Barbie has the perfect life in Barbie World. Then suddenly she yearns to see the ""real world."" Where did we see that storyline before? Let's see... I know... The Little Mermaid and a hundred other movies ripping off the same plot.But if that's not bad enough, we have to sit through dreary dialogue such as Ken wanting to sleep over with Barbie while being totally innocent of sex and the fairy god mother pressuring Barbie to reject the high heels in order to seek enlightenment, as if Barbie should not make the choice on her own without somebody prodding her in a particular direction.Even the people who like it can't point to anything original in it. Where that 77% comes from is beyond me.",Barbie
4.0,I'd probably drop it at around 1/2 if I watched it alone at home,Joytoyxx,20 July 2023,"Attending the prepremiere of the much-anticipated Barbie movie was an experience I won't soon forget, but unfortunately, not for the right reasons. At least 85% of the movie was pure hype, creating high expectations that were ultimately let down.The film seemed primarily aimed at a teenage audience, with its trendy aesthetics and themes, but it struggled to find its identity. It swung between childish and adultish elements, making it challenging to categorize and leaving viewers like me feeling a bit perplexed about its target demographic.In the first two-thirds of the movie, I managed to find a few moments to laugh, but my interest began to wane as it entered the final third. The lack of a compelling plot and engaging storytelling made it a tedious watch, and I found myself almost falling asleep in the cinema.One of the major letdowns was the extensive marketing that overshadowed the entire experience. What made the movie even more uncomfortable for me was the audience's overwhelming obsession with everything pink. Nearly 90% of the cinema-goers were dressed in various shades of pink, and it felt like an extravagant posing session rather than an immersive movie experience. It did not help that movie itself was pretty average - it heavily depends on references and superficial jokes, which can be amusing on occasion. However, after being exposed to nearly two hours of such content, I was completely brain damaged .I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from a Barbie movie, but this certainly wasn't it. It fell into the same pit as some of Disney's live-action adaptations that fail to capture the essence of the original material.Despite having a few moments of laughter and initial intrigue, I wouldn't rate it more than 4 out of 10. If you're looking for a meaningful cinematic experience, this film might not be the best choice.",Barbie
9.0,"Great movie, but not Nolan's best",paulbenjmn,22 July 2023,"Oppenheimer has been one of the most anticipated movies of 2023. With an award-winning cast, Director of Photography Hoyte van Hoytema and composer Ludwig Göransson, many fans hoped that Oppenheimer would be as fascinating as Nolan's older productions - and it is.First of all, the movie is produced in a technically outstanding way. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is good, though not as masterful as Wally Pfister's cinematography in older Nolan movies such as The Dark Knight (2008) or Inception (2010). Van Hoytema often shows close-ups of Oppenheimer's face, which draws the viewer right into his thoughtfulness and into his emotions. The movie looks amazing and one can really feel the tension, especially in IMAX theaters.Furthermore, Ludwig Göransson's score ist just amazing. It underlines the tension of the movie as well as the characters emotions and thoughts in an incredible way and really draws the viewer into the story. The music is beautiful and together with van Hoytema's cinematography, the viewers find themselves in a stunning atmosphere.Secondly, the actors perform brilliantly. Especially Cillian Murphy's performance as Oppenheimer is exceptional. Even though he changes his facial expressions only slightly, he conveys so much of the inner thoughts and emotions of Oppenheimer through his eyes - truly outstanding. It would not be surprising to me if he wins an Oscar for this performance, I haven't seen any better eye-acting yet!Already on the first images that were released from the film one could see that he was the perfect pick for Oppenheimer's role. Wearing a hat and having a cigarette in the corner of his mouth the resemblance to the real physicist is remarkable.Moreover, also Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss does an incredible job. Of course he has shown many times that he is an exceptional actor but this performance still tops his performances in older films.All in all, the whole cast does a great job. Emily Blunt as Kitty Oppenheimer, Matt Damon as Leslie Groves or Rami Malek as Dr. Hill, they all show how talented they are and all serve a masterful performance.All of Nolan's movies stand out with an incredible cast, but Oppenheimer tops all of them. Many actors would deserve an Oscar for their performance - even those who only had a few minutes on the screen.However, let's talk about the storytelling. Oppenheimer is based on the biography ""American Prometheus: The triumph and tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer"". The 3h long movie, which can be separated into three acts, consists mostly of dialogue scenes. Nolan uses a creative approach and filmed on coloured and black-and-white film to distinguish between a more personal and a more objective view.Just like in his other films, Nolan wants to encourage the viewer to think. Even though the story is not as complex as for instance Tenet's story, one cannot just sink in the seat and relax. Nolan wants to challenge the viewer, he wants him to think on his own and develop an own opinion on the topic. And yes, because of the many important dialogues and the abundance of physicists and other people that play a role in the movie, it may seem quite overwhelming at first. Every scene takes an important role in the development of the movie and cannot be missed. In general, the storytelling is on-point, creative and convincing.Nevertheless, whereas action scenes in Inception or Tenet or silent shots of the intergalactic space in Interstellar allowed the viewers to process what they just saw, Oppenheimer just goes on and on. As a consequence, there is only limited space for feelings to grow and the movie seems almost too mathematically planned for an emotionally touching biopic.Furthermore, in my opinion, the movie is a little bit overpacked with information and too long. Of course, every person is important and this is the historically most correct approach but if Nolan had focused more on one topic (for instance the trinity test or the hearings) the movie would have been even more stunning and more meaningful. In the first half of the movie, the viewer does not really become acquainted to the person Oppenheimer and his thoughts. The movie depicts all the stations in his life in an objective manner, without letting the viewer grasp many emotions (which is inevitable for a biopic in my opinion).The first hour of the movie might be a little bit overwhelming at first, because many characters are introduced and the different scenes might seem incoherent.However, the movie gathers momentum and becomes more and more thrilling.The last third of the movie is surely the most packing and stunning one. Here, the story is the most focused and narrated in an extraordinary and exciting way. All the threads are brought together, which is why it is definitely the strongest part of the movie.Of course, the ending is (as always in Nolan-movies) amazing and rounds up the film in an outstanding manner. It also encourages the viewer to think again, so that nobody is just standing up from their seat and leaving the cinema without thinking about what they just saw.In general, Nolan produced an amazing movie with a great cast, amazing music and an interesting story. However, his older movies such as The Dark Knight, Inception or Dunkirk are overall more rounded, focused and meaningful, which is why I have been a little bit disappointed. I expected Nolan to produce his best movie given the cast and the story with a lot of potential. In my opinion, Nolan did not exploit all the potential that Oppenheimer's story provides.However, Nolan created a thought-provoking movie that is definitely one of the best biopic/dramas of this decade.He succeeded his goal to challenge the viewer and make them think about the topic on their own. Even three days after watching the biopic, I cannot let go of thinking about the stunning story and its significant impact.Before watching Oppenheimer, one should know that just like Tenet, Oppenheimer is not a movie for the masses. Because of its long duration, long dialogue sequences and rather complex storytelling, many people will probably get off without even understanding what Nolan wanted to show them. If you really want to understand the movie and enjoy its story, you need to commit to it and focus on what Nolan is showing you. Otherwise, the movie might seem boring - because you did not get to the core of its story!07/10- Cinematography, 10/10 - Music & Sound, 10/10 - Cast performance, 08/10 - Story/Script, 09/10 - Directing,-> 09/10 overall.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Heartwarming Mother and Daughter movie,debcrupi,22 July 2023,"My 20 year old daughter and I loved this movie so much. It was adorable and funny and surprisingly heartwarming. I really think anyone would enjoy this though. It had such a sweet simple message done so colorfully. Perfect casting. Margot Robbie literally is a doll. And Ryan Gosling is a combination of hot and funny. We wore pink of course and saw some cute outfits. A couple Ken shirts. While we were leaving, still teary eyed, seeing the mothers, daughters, friends and sisters all wearing pink, it was so touching and we thought how lucky they were to be able to watch Barbie for the first time. I still feel emotional hours later thinking about it. Highly recommend.",Barbie
1.0,Offended hindu bhagwatgita,bickykapar,23 July 2023,"The new film 'Oppenheimer' by Christopher Nolan premiered in big-screen cinemas worldwide. The biopic by the director, starring Cillian Murphy, has drawn a lot of attention in India as well, particularly for bringing up the sacred text Bhagavad Gita.J. Robert Oppenheimer, a physicist who is credited with creating the atomic bomb, is the focus of the movie. Oppenheimer was the head of Los Alamos Laboratory and a key player in the Manhattan Project, an initiative by the government to carry out research into the making of nuclear weapons.While Florence Pugh portrays Jean Tatlock, Cillian Murphy plays Oppenheimer. Murphy stated that he had read the Hindu holy scripture for the movie before it was released. Unexpectedly, it appeared in an intimate scene in the movie.The sequence didn't sit well with viewers, who questioned the CBFC for allowing the release of this movie without removing a scene that would offend religious sentiments.Source - ABP News.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Christopher Nolan has done it again!,ndbzrnkts,28 July 2023,"I was not disappointed when I left the theatre and there wasn't a moment in the three hours I was there that I wasn't enthralled with the story. Some say that biopics lack suspense, but I found myself holding my breath. That's what good filmmaking is, and boy does Christopher Nolan know what he's doing when writing a story for the screen. This of course was based on true events, but the format in which Nolan shows us the story is reminiscent of Memento with the dual perspective black and white vs color, that I think works really well here. The women in the film were not reduced like they often are in historical biopics, but they were characters with their own arcs and developments. The practical effects were visually captivating, and film choices like camera angles, lighting, and soundtrack all helped add meaning behind the visual while at the same time immersing the viewer in the time period.Cillian Murphy was very believable in the role, as were Oppenheimer's feelings as they were portrayed not just by Murphy, but by the rest of Nolan's artistic choices. Robert Downey Jr. Made a very convincing Strauss, showing off his range as an actor as he departed from the fast-talking acting style he perfected during his contract with Marvel.While sound mixing has oft been a problem for Nolan movies played on differing formats like with Tenet, that was not an issue here. The bombs were realistically louder than the average volume of the movie, but the dialogue was all audible.All in all, I think this is a movie was if anything, underhyped and is one I'll definitely watch again. I hope Nolan chooses to do more movies like this.",Oppenheimer
9.0,"Exceptional, Incredible, Mature and Somewhat Depressing",tfpdbbxck,25 July 2023,"I walked into Oppenheimer expecting something incredible, and that is what I got. Oppenheimer is truly Christopher Nolan at his best in terms of script writing, directing and film making. The score, the cinematography, everything about this film is fantastic. Some may find the 3 hour runtime a bit daunting but it doesn't feel like 3 hours at all! The performances from all the cast are amazing and they make the characters truly believable, but Cillian Murphy shines the brightest as he finally gets the lead role in a Nolan Film. His performance is worthy of an Oscar Nomination if not a win. This film is a 100% go see! Watch it in IMAX, it's an incredible experience. However, if you don't like dialogue driven movies then this might not be for you, but I would still recommend you see this work of art. It is a mature story with some sex scenes but if you're 14, mature 13 I would say it's fine.",Oppenheimer
9.0,A great balance between social commentary and pure fun,spelakokosinek,19 July 2023,"The movie starts with the presentation of iconic barbie world and hilarious childhood references but it gets progressively deeper.It tackles sexism, misogyny and existentialism. While it left me crying laughing it appeared a bit all over the place. I believe it would be a lot beter if it had only focused on one theme.Other than that it was an insanely self-aware, bizarre, iconic, relatable and suprisingly deep movie. Greta knew what she was doing. Goslings line delivery was hilarious and Robbie added range to an expectedly superficial character.I would also like to mention the heatbreaking yet beautiful Billie Eilish masterpiece of a song. Great job!",Barbie
6.0,A mature take on Barbie,mlnicholson,25 July 2023,"The latest installment in the Barbie movie franchise takes an unexpected turn, veering away from the child-friendly themes that fans have come to expect. In this new adventure, Barbie finds herself navigating the complexities of the real world, facing a stark realisation that men rule the world - much to Ken's delight.While this plotline may spark debate and offer an occasion for intellectual discourse, it's crucial to remember the intended audience of such movies. Given its 12A certificate, this film should not be regarded as a children's movie. Parents expecting lighthearted entertainment may be caught off-guard when sitting down with their young ones.For those who are able to appreciate its more mature themes and humour, moments of levity can be found. However, with a slow beginning that only picks up halfway through, some viewers may struggle to maintain interest. Furthermore, the film's rushed conclusion leaves much to be desired and falls short in satisfying fans' craving for a cohesive storyline.Potential audience members should weigh whether the departure from traditional child-oriented content is worth viewing or not.In summary, while this unique approach to a Barbie movie has its merits, it should be approached with caution by parents of younger children due to its mature themes and occasional tedium.",Barbie
4.0,A big mess wrapped up in pink.,ivonanejic,23 July 2023,"The marketing for this movie was incredible, so are actors and the whole setting. Not only does that attract a massive audience, but also seeing the famous doll many grew up with. Unfortunately, once I got into my theather seat the hype begin to wear drown. I can't wrap my mind around all the positive reviews on the script and Greta because the plot of this movie is full of major gaps and unreached points. It dives into politics but can't decide what to do with it so instead runs a couple of pointless monolouges that bring no value or add to the conclusion of the movie whatsoever. Not to mention I found myself consistently unsure of what is happening and why. This movie presents itself as a comedy and the audience was dead quiet throught the whole thing! Kudos to Ryan Gosling whose acting skills might be the highlight of this whole experience even when Ken as a charachter made little to no sense. All this amazing cast and promotion might've been too big of a bite for the directors. It felt like they exploited that in all possible ways in order to cover up a weak plot.",Barbie

6.0,ABUSE OF THE BARBIE,silvangigerstudio,25 July 2023,"Here's the thing.In my eyes BARBIE happens at the beginning of the movie. Amazingly created world with great looks and surprises now and then. Lovely! But then it feels like all about BARBIE is forgotten within seconds except for the pink color of course. The movie turns into a quite weird direction with happenings that are very sought and often don't make any sense at all. Suddenly everyone can jump around between two worlds and no one thinks that's crazy actually.Suddenly the difference between Kens, Barbies and Human beings is gone away ALTHOUGH in the beginning it shows definite differences like feet or fingers that aren't separate. Later on Ken plays the guitar and can move every single finger for example. All in all the great love for detail from the beginning is gone quite fast and turns into a long childish and boring battle between manly men and fimaly females. It starts to look like the TV-show Love Island. A loud unnecessary back and forth between genders. At the end a try of a deep scene to let go a few deep words and that's it. The movie teaches nothing to take home with. It's more like the name BARBIE was abused for this one in my eyes.",Barbie

6.0,Not all is peachy when things get preachy,eddie_baggins,27 July 2023,"It feels like its been some time since a film release has gripped the world quite like the way in which Barbie has over recent weeks/months, with the Greta Gerwig directed box office sensation creating a global phenomenon that has translated to record breaking openings in cinemas, critical plaudits and audience adoration on a scale that is mostly just a dream for Hollywood bigwigs.A talent-laden affair in front of the camera with Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling leading the charge as plastic icons Barbie and Ken respectively and also behind the camera with Gerwig teaming up with her real life partner Noah Baumbach to bring Matel's beloved creation to life, Barbie is far better than it has any right to be as we explore Barbie Land and the real world with our protagonists, in what amounts to a pink fever dream that recalls old school Tim Burton at its peak, Barbie is also a little too heavy handed in the way in which it hammers home its messaging, making the film one that doesn't always correctly balance its oddball charm with preachy messaging.A film that in many ways had become too big too fail with anticipation around the one half of Barbenheimer (with the weighty Oppenheimer no doubt benefiting hugely from the cross promotion) reaching fever pitch levels all over the globe, the adoration aimed at Gerwig's film right now feels like the type of over the top praise that will be reevaluated in coming months/years too something more grounded, with Gerwig and her team deserving of praise for creating such a colourful world and giving us something that doesn't just feel like a two hour long toy commercial but also going over the top in its empowerment messaging that feels like a message swung too far into the direction of all men are patriarchal menaces who aren't deserving of the women in their lives.At its best when it allows its stars a chance to play within the confines of a likeable fish out of water tale where Barbie and Ken roam the boardwalks of Venice Beach adorned in skin tight Lycra or where Gosling's MVP performance as Ken see's the horse obsessed and Matchbox 20 loving beach bound man child bring too life a range of hilarious situations and sentiments, Barbie gets bogged down when it turns its attention to preaching too the converted and fails to make the most of its ""human"" characters like America Ferrera's Gloria or Will Ferrell's unnecessary tickle loving Mattel CEO, forgoing its comedic charms to try and be something it might naturally have become anyway had it dialled back the politics and just decided to be the fun escapist entertainment it often utilises.When fun and adventure is at the forefront of Barbie's agenda, Gerwig's film is an undeniable delight and you'd be hard pressed to recall a more colorful and playful film when Barbie is in full flight but with all the hyperbole coming thick and fast right at this moment in time, it's hard not too consider Barbie's public sentiments being blown up out of proportion as the films misses are overlooked in favour of viewers preferring to watch this cultural touchstone with a pair of (pink) rose-tinted glasses.Final Say -There's fun to be had from Barbie and the commitment of its two leads is a sight to behold, as is the world which Gerwig brings to life but when Barbie forgoes the fun and playfulness it thrives in in favour of repetitive messaging, the film becomes more of a slog than an enjoyment.3 Mojo Dojo Casa House's out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",Barbie

I won't reveal any details about the movie, but I had a visceral, physiological reaction at multiple points during this film. My stomach was in knots, I began to feel very hot to the point that I was sweating. My arms tingled, similarly to the way they do when I am under a lot of pressure. It almost felt as though I was going to break out in hives. I cannot exactly claim that this experience was pleasant, but my body's reaction to this film experience was overwhelming. I could not help but to cry. This movie was incredibly moving in a way that I had never experienced before in a movie theatre. This film is very special.",Oppenheimer
9.0,"Great movie, but you need to read the history to understand it",gp1-3,26 July 2023,"First and foremost, I thought this was a terrific movie, the acting performances were just outstanding. There are already plenty of reviews extolling the performances, and so I'll focus instead on some constructive criticism and helpful advice instead.A few things are enough to bring this movie down from a ""10"":1. The hype about watching this movie in IMAX was overblown. This movie has A LOT OF DIALOGUE, and lots of scenes of two people talking to each other, and so.... guess what, the bulk of that glorious 70mm IMAX footage is of two talking heads shot in glorious 70mm IMAX closeup. So yeah, unless you really enjoy analyzing the makeup progression on Cillian Murphy's face, from a callow youth with a clean fresh faced complexion and wild hair, to the beginnings of wrinkles and eyebags and a few gray hairs, well, that 70mm screen isn't really necessary, to be honest2. Reading some of the history before watching the history will help a lot to understand this movie when watching it for the first time, otherwise you will be as totally lost as I was when watching Nolan's ""Tenet"". Once again, Nolan breaks up the movie into roughly 4 different time segments, and presents them in flashback and out of sequence jumbled order. As a history buff and having read a lot of this history already, it all made sense to me, but anybody else would get easily confused.3. Subtitles would help! I've gotten so used to watching things digitally with the closed captioning or subtitles that I really wished there were subtitles available (I do plan to watch this movie again once it goes digital, with subtitles turned on). Even with the IMAX theater's speakers turned on full blast to an almost uncomfortable level, it was still hard to hear some of the whispered dialogue.5. Nolan needs to bring Hans Zimmer back. I guess the two broke up when Zimmer took on ""Dune"" instead of ""Tenet"", but Ludwig Göransson's music just isn't in the same class of powerful memorable themes, and was even grating at times.Despite these relatively minor complaints, this was a great movie. There were a few tiny almost cameo roles that turned out to have great significance as the ending wrapped up - another Nolan trait. Watch for Rami Malek - he is so instantly recognizable that I wondered what the heck he was doing there as an extra just standing there in the background in one scene, and fumbling a clipboard on Oppenheimer in his second scene, and then he appears as the surprise witness in the Senate confirmation hearings of Oppenheimer's arch enemy Lewis Strauss.Go see this movie in the theaters, it's worth it. Then watch it again on digital streaming, with subtitles.",Oppenheimer
10.0,GOAT Director With GOAT Cast,robiulman,21 July 2023,"The Movie, The Perfection. Nolan never disappoint us.I give Oppenheimer a 10/10 rating. It is a masterpiece of filmmaking, with stunning visuals, a gripping narrative, and an unforgettable performance from Murphy. The film is both epic in scope and intimate in its exploration of Oppenheimer's inner turmoil. It is a must-see for anyone interested in history, science, or the human condition.Here are some of the things that I loved about the film:The visuals are stunning. The film was shot on IMAX 70mm film, and the images are breath-taking. The film's use of color is also masterful, with a palette that evokes the era and the subject matter.The narrative is gripping. The film tells the story of Oppenheimer's life and work in a way that is both engaging and informative. The film does not shy away from the difficult ethical questions that Oppenheimer faced, and it does so in a way that is both thought-provoking and emotionally resonant.The performances are top-notch. Murphy gives a tour-de-force performance as Oppenheimer. He captures the scientist's brilliance, his passion, and his inner turmoil with equal measure. The supporting cast is also excellent, with standout performances from Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, and Matt Damon.Overall, Oppenheimer is a masterpiece of filmmaking. It is a must-see for anyone interested in history, science, or the human condition. I highly recommend it.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Fun but occasionally confused with itself.,tompmcr,23 July 2023,"I'll start with the issues, because overall this movie was enjoyable if you don't take it too seriously.The majority of the movie is a lighthearted comedy. The biggest tool a comedy has to use for conveying societal criticisms is satire. The beauty of satire is that you can make some really good points. When the movie used satire to make it's points it was great. But the 5% of the time that it forgot about the comedy altogether and tried to take itself too seriously (I'm not saying the subject itself matter wasn't serious) conflicted with it's own tone. You can make all the points you want to make with a biting satire without stomping on your own tone.The ending for Barbie was felt misguided. Without spoiling it, there's a point between when the final conflict is resolved and the very last scene of the movie where barbie experiences something. It looks like the scene is supposed to be deep and insightful, but it honestly felt like the writers got to that point in the movie and didn't know how to end it, so they just kinda piled on some abstract feelings and vague phrases for a transition. Sort of like a high schooler writing an essay and not knowing how to write a concluding paragraph.The middle school girl character is a 1 dimensional character, but writing young children characters seems to be a challenge for Hollywood so you can't blame them too much. And lastly the whole car chase scene was a blatant Chevy ad to the point that it was almost funny itself.Now the good: The visuals and characters were all done really well, and not just Robbie and Reynolds but the rest of the cast. The movie itself was really entertaining and worth a watch.",Barbie
5.0,Visually stunning great acting but so boring and complicated for a large chunk of audience,sachinkorjani,21 July 2023,"I was so excited to see this movie since I am a big Nolan and Murphy fan, but I am hugely disappointed, the movie was too long and boring most of the times, they just glorified the act of making and dropping bombs(same usa propoganda).No doubt the visuals and acting was amazing but to sit through 3 hours and watch people just talk and arguing was not entertaining at all, they didn't even show the scenes or real bombing and what happened aftermath the bombings in Japan, there were too many characters to keep track of. Yes it has some scenes which will amaze and awe the viewers but overall it was disappointing for me😒",Oppenheimer
10.0,A master work from a master director.,jaketlogsdon,24 July 2023,"There came a point about midway into this film where my lungs began to hurt really bad. And then, not long after, I felt my whole body lurch and gasp for air. Turns out, I had quit breathing. That was how tense and on edge I was. Oppenheimer is a lot of movie to take in. At times, moments feel unnecessarily long and slow, but I believe that those things truly pale in comparison to the things this film does so well. For one, the casting choices are sensational. Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer will be remembered as one of the greatest casting choices in cinema. And of course, the rest of the cast reads like a who's who of Hollywood elite, and they provide incredible performances of their own. Robert Downey Jr., Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Jack Quaid, Josh Peck, Gary Oldham, and more. It's exceedingly rare having this level of talent in one movie. The sound design and cinematography of this movie is also Oscar worthy in every sense. The ticking of Geiger counters, Murphy's awed breathing as he watches the rolling flames in the aftermath of the atomic bomb's detonation, the camera flashes, it all pairs so well together. Oppenheimer is a film that must be experienced as much with the ears as much as the eyes. And, of course, the thing that Oppenheimer does best is how it supplants the audience in the shoes of its titular character. There are several moments throughout this film where it's hard to distinguish the feelings of the man on screen and the audience watching him. The weight of decisions he makes is felt on and off the screen. You can feel the burden that's on his shoulders as the implications of his achievements become clear. Oppenheimer is one of the most complicated men in all of history and Christopher Nolan has managed to tell his story for a new audience in a way that is sympathetic, honest, and prophetic. It is not a happy movie by any means, nor should it be. The life and times of J. Robert Oppenheimer is one of tragedy, not just personally, but for the legacy he is now fixed to. Through him, man has harnessed the power to create destruction on a mass scale. The man himself is gone, but his legacy remains to bear witness to both the limitless possibilities of science, and its consequences. This is an important film, and it needs to be viewed as often. A masterpiece in every sense.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Changes your perspective,nmwgpqj-78877,22 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan's 'Oppenheimer,' deserves all the praise that it gets. It's a Nolan film and you get more than what you had paid for. The movie despite its 3 hour runtime doesn't fail to keep me engaged, however if you are the typical average audience then I can see how you would manage to be bored throughout the movie. The movie was super realistic and makes me appreciate Cillian Murphy as an actor. I have to say - the cast is wonderful and Nolan really knows how to put them to work. Throughout the film there were times I would get tremendously sweaty, so nervous that I would firmly grasp the side of my seat. The movie is a masterpiece and the best bibliographical movie I've ever seen.",Oppenheimer
4.0,Big Budget Fluff,celt007,22 July 2023,"Unfortunately this story is so bad the acting and sets can't save it .It is pretty to look at like a Barbie , but lacks a story that is worth the effort .I think small girls will like it but other than that it's a stupid movie idea that comes across as an advertisement for a toy company .Not sure you will want to spend your money on this wait for it to stream .Kids fell asleep after the first 30 minutes .Not sure who the audience is .The story is so bad it's like it was hobbled together by a bunch of tweens brainstorming .I think this could be the worst movie of the decade .There are much better kids movies out there.",Barbie

10.0,OPPENHEIMER,bell-benn,26 July 2023,"""Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to man. For this, he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity."" ""I am become death, the destroyer of worlds"" These are two tag lines from Christopher Nolan's excellent Bio-pic, Oppenheimer, which I saw yesterday. Perhaps the best and most important film made in the last 100 years That is to say, ever! Must see in IMAX! Highest quality, both for sound and visuals. The acting was superb. Cillian Murphy was excellent as Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr. Gave perhaps the best performance of his career. One should never forget two things. There are warring nations on Earth right now that have nuclear weapons capable of destroying the world and wiping out civilization. And the other thing is The United States is the only country in the world to drop an atomic bomb on another country. The targets were cities populated by civilians. It is debatable whether this heinous act saved lives or ended the war. But one thing for sure is that tens of thousands of people were instantaneously incinerated and thousands more died of radiation poisoning. This is a heavy burden to carry as an American and as Oppenheimer himself said, we have blood on our hands. Go see this movie!",Oppenheimer
10.0,The most fun I've had at the movies in AGES!,candycoatedmisery,20 July 2023,"I absolutely LOVED this movie! It was everything I could have ever wanted it to be and THEN SOME! Fun, empowering, intelligent, socially relevant, deeply moving and by far the pinkest movie l've ever seen! An all around an amazing experience and there's something in it for everyone! All genders, all ages, everyone can appreciate it. The entire audience seemed to have a blast throughout the movie. Everyone was laughing during the funny bits(and there were A LOT of them) and during the heartfelt, more emotional moments you could feel the energy shift and the messages the movie was trying to convey really being taken in. Amazing cast, excellent cinematography, fantastic soundtrack, you definitely want to see this one!",Barbie
9.0,Delicious,dsfgrc,27 July 2023,"Hard to concentrate on the fast moving but perfectly constructed screenplay as Cilligan's azure eyes are possibly more mesmeric than Peter O'Toole's Laurence. He displays the contradictions 'Oppie' perfectly; the scientist, the agitator, the womanizer, the friend. Despite not knowing a positive proton if it bit me, the film is highly doable, and the whole cast delivers on drama and character, thete's not one bum note. Aside from the main lead, there are stellar turns from Robery Downey Jr., Matt Damon, & Emily Blunt, the first I might say, should garner some quality nominations and it's a joy to see this actor clearly working at the top of his game. You should enjoy this film very much.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Oscars all around,hbagwell-45001,24 July 2023,"This movie had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, easily the easiest 3 hours of film watching ever. The great juxtaposition of the brilliance and downfall of man and the destruction science/men can bring. The music was amazing, the acting exceptional and the end very thought provoking.Every scene felt totally immersive and engaging. I felt the fear of the scientist when creating a new form of weapon and not knowing if it would destory the whole world upon detention. I felt the guilt of Oppenheimer and realizing what he actually had accomplished. It was such a beautiful masterpiece that leaves you thinking. I will definitely be making the story of Oppenheimer my new hyper fixation of the month.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Amazing cinematography,kkssharma-37018,21 July 2023,"It's almost as if the trajectory of Christopher Nolan's career was leading up to this film, but I don't think I was expecting ""Oppenheimer"" to leave me this moved as this very well could be the best film he's ever directed and his actual masterpiece. Being based on the book ""American Prometheus,"" we get the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer who was brought on by Lewis Strauss to helm the Manhattan Project that led to the creation of the atomic bomb but Nolan's focus was on the mam himself and not the bomb which proves to be brilliant as we get a deep and haunting character study of the aftermath and see how this action led to not only thousands of deaths in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but the guilt and weight that the ""man who moved the earth"" was forced to live with. Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer proves to be the best casting choice made for this biopic as his eyes in close-ups tell you everything you need to know about what he's thinking, but in addition this brilliant actor conveys so much conviction and deep regret for all of his skeletons that you're left with a broken man who started off doing something monumental with ambitious intentions but slowly realizes what he's just actually done to the rest of the world, but Robert Downey Jr. As Strauss has my lock already for Best Supporting Actor with what could be his best career work as a man who proves to be more than an antagonist in this film.",Oppenheimer
10.0,"Heart-warming, serious and such an important movie for everyone to see!",bm230199,22 July 2023,"When I sat down to watch this film I assumed it would be some fun pink silly movie but it was not in the best possible way. It starts very much in that way but the second Barbie gets to the real world everything changes and the film makes so many important statements on sexism and the treatment of women. I thought it perfectly addressed the affect Barbie has had on the world and never shied away from it. This movie does not flinch away from the reality of the world or what damage ignorance can do (Ken). America Ferrera's speech is amazing and moved me so much as did Barbie's own found freedom. Robbie was an amazing Barbie and all the women shined in this movie...and Alan was pretty good too. It was everything you can want from a movie, sharp, whitty, moving, honest and progressive. The perfect Barbie.",Barbie
8.0,A frustrating almost masterpiece that is still a must see,druss44121-1,21 July 2023,"Be aware, I'm not tagging this review with spoilers, but I will discuss some of the real life history. If you believe that would count as a spoiler stop reading now.Okay, with that out of the way...Oppenheimer is a dense, talkie, mature, multilayered character study that does a lot right. This is probably Nolan's most mature film when it comes to politics and historical complexity, as it deals with the paradoxical realities of the era its set in and offers a truly three dimensional portrait of its main characters and especially Oppenheimer himself. There are some incredible performances here, including career best work from Cillian Murphy as the lead. The music score is fantastic, although it sometimes drowns out the dialogue, and the film is beautifully shot. I know some reviews have said this is an ""ugly"" film but I completely disagree. There are some truly awe-inspiring shots here and everything fits the story and the tone well. I saw this in regular 70mm and will see it again in IMAX 70mm in a few days. Some of the best shots are deceptively simple ones.In fact, I'd say the first 2/3rds of this movie are a genuine masterpiece. The pacing is exceptional. The editing reminded me a bit of some of Oliver Stone's 90s movies (like JFK or Natural Born Killers) or Scorsese's faster paced films, and it really helps to get you into the head of Oppenheimer himself. There are some shots where dialogue isn't properly synced, but I think this fit the headspace of the main character. In other words, Nolan was purposely breaking the rules. There's one scene that blatantly breaks the 180 rule and it's incredibly effective at disorienting the audience in the same way Oppenheimer himself is disoriented.So yes, I'd say this a 9/10 or even 10/10 movie right up to the actual Trinity test. And then the film kinda falls apart. Most importantly, the test itself is hugely underwhelming. This is a case where Nolan's insistence on doing everything practically is actually a net negative. The explosion never looks like an actual atom bomb. It's clearly just a big explosion they did for real in the desert, and while there is some wonderful sound design in this scene, it never captures the awe and terror that we need to feel. A little bit of CGI enhancement could have gone a long way. Even in the old days things weren't just done for real; you'd sometimes use composite effects or miniatures to create a desired effect bigger than anything you could capture entirely in camera.Regardless of what you think of the show, Twin Peaks had an episode that depicts the Trinity test in one long unbroken shot, and that single shot is far more effective than anything we see here at actually depicting the almost mystical terror of the atom bomb. If you took that scene and cut it into this movie, with snap cuts to the reaction shots, you'd have a much more powerful sequence. The film spends a long time building up to this and it's so underwhelming that it's hard to not be disappointed. I could tell the energy of the packed audience also changed after this scene, and people started to get a little antsy in their seats.Speaking of which: most of the last act is meandering, overly talkie, and stagnant. I don't know why the film decided to focus so much on a character other than Oppenheimer; that may have worked well in a miniseries, but for a feature all of that could have been condensed into a third of the time and instead we could have spent more time with Oppenheimer coming to terms with his feelings about what he did and his role in world history. This is when the breakneck cutting finally needed to slow down and let us breathe a bit, but if anything, it just speeds up, like it's trying to get through a billion things at once. The last act of the film kinda feels like homework.With that said, the very last five minutes are incredible, and gave me chills. It's probably my favorite ending sequence from any Nolan film.This is an ambitious and complex work, and it's worth seeing. It has some of Nolan's finest directing in it and you will be thinking about it after you leave the theater. But it can't quite stick the landing. Compare this to another biopic, Lawrence of Arabia (in my humble opinion probably the greatest biopic ever made). There's a great scene where a man yells out to Lawrence, ""WHO ARE YOU??"" and the shot lingers and holds on his face. It's an incredible moment of filmmaking and acting at their best. In Oppenheimer, this scene would have been half the length and intercut with three other scenes at the same time. In other words, the last act this film desperately needed to slow down and focus more on the psychology of its characters and less on the politics. It also would have been great to see some additional scenes following the end of WW2, such as the demon core accident which happened in August of 1945.With all of that said, this is still a GOOD movie, and anyone remotely interested in history or filmmaking should see it. For me, Nolan's best films are still The Prestige, Memento and Inception, but this may win him an Oscar.",Oppenheimer
7.0,Chaotic and powerful,pkertes-59666,23 July 2023,"You really need your wits about you to follow this film. There are frequent and often quite rapid cuts to different time periods, perhaps a little overdone at times. Nolan helps by filming all of the Lewis Strauss (played beautifully by Robert Downey Jnr) scenes in black and white.The pace is relentless yet I still felt the film was just a little bit too long - the first hour in particular was at times even a little boring. Once we get to the Trinity test, the film absolutely soars - although everyone knows what happened, the film becomes breath-taking and powerful. The subsequent scenes involving the witch-hunt against Oppenheimer and the senate hearings to confirm Strauss's cabinet position are impressive.The acting is uniformly good, especially RDJ. I thought Cillian Murphy's portrayal of Oppenheimer was good but just a little too quixotic - you're never quite sure exactly what he believes, especially in the first half. It was great to see Tom Conti again, although maybe a little miscast as Einstein. Florence Pugh was given a few rather gratuitously explicit sex scenes, which I thought were just a little too bizarre. And as usual there were very good performances from Emily Blunt and Matt Damon.Another major gripe is the soundtrack - appropriate in style but way too loud, detracting from the visual experience at times.All in all a powerful but imperfect movie, certainly worth seeing, but it will require your intense concentration to keep up with the chaos at times. Not quite a masterpiece in my book.",Oppenheimer
6.0,It was good but far too preachy,terryforma,24 July 2023,"I really enjoyed the movie. The acting was amazing. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling was amazing. I just thought it was too on the nose. Like the message was literally forced in your face. It seemed lazy to me. I went in thinking it was going to be similar to The Truman Show and I wished it had've taken some elements from it because it would've made it much more powerful if so. I'm not going to spoil the ending but I thought the writers just gave up. Overall for me it's a 6/10. Good film but that's all. Definitely could've been less preachy. Ultimately, it's nice movie to see and I'd see it again at some point but it wasn't great.",Barbie
8.0,"While it is not Christopher Nolan's magnum opus, this is still one of his best works in history.",iamianiman,20 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan, whose previous works use time and space as his playground, did it once again with this based on a true story film, something that we didn't expect. His way of storytelling proves that he's the greatest directors to ever live on the planet, mastering in building up the story all the while keeping the audience engaged by elevating its suspense, scope, atmosphere and music tempos, creating a masterpiece ouevre.Oppenheimer is a visceral experience. It is able to create and provoke tension and anxiety in their audience. Rarely do we ever get this type of films offering this kind of experience but Nolan did it, just like Interstellar or Inception. It is haunting. It is moving. It is evocative. It knows what it tries to deliver and it does so well in eliciting these emotions as you sit and witness through it all.Verdict: Hauntingly beautiful, Oppenheimer feels like a ticking time bomb as it evokes a strong visceral and immersive experience. Almost everything is done right, Christopher Nolan makes sure this film blows us away with a rich story, stark character studies, strong dialogues, powerful music score, impeccable acting amongst many others. While it is not Christopher Nolan's magnum opus, this is still one of his best ouevre in history.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Intense.,davidimarzio-42375,21 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan breaks out of his bubble of fiction into the openness of realism. Put together: Motivation, lack of motivation, madness, genius, success, fame, conscience, regret, empathy, betrayal and many other scenarios and feelings in a single work bordering on the impossible, which the director should already know. Speaking and explicitly showing the political scenario of the Second World War era on the big screen is not an easy job, which makes it impossible to fully understand what one wants to convey through frames and scenes that are so opaque in sense, when at the same time full. The superficiality of the work has to be noted. A lot of elements were used, as there was no escape, so it makes the pace slower and more angsty, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Some things should have been more detailed, but they weren't. Cinematography? Flawless. Soundtrack? Flawless. Acting? Flawless. 8.5/10.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Cute but not for everyone,kedziorek6,22 July 2023,"Yes it was a bit preachy at times (the feminist speech that the mom/America Ferrera gave in the middle of the movie was out of place) but overall the message was ok and the movie was cute. I had some doubts about casting but Ryan Gosling killed it and Margot Robbie is obviously the closest to a real life Barbie you could get in the modern day.I'm not really sure the target age demographic either. I'm 17 and saw it with my mom and we both liked it, but idk it might not be great for super little kids. It's not overly vulgar or anything but at times it seems more focused on appealing to teenage girls and grown women.Also, Michael Cera is rad and probably the best part of the movie for me. His role is super fitting and it's fun to see him dressed all in pastel and pink, being a relatively normal dude in scenes full of Barbies.",Barbie
10.0,Masterpiece,bergy-97063,26 July 2023,"I walked into this movie with the expectation of it being anywhere from a top 5 Chris Nolan film to a Top 5 film of all time. Seeing it in IMAX, witnessing, feeling and experiencing the film in full force. I can honestly say it's closer to the ladder than the former for me. Am I saying it's 100% a top 5 film of all time? No necessarily but I think it's of the cloth of all those films like the Godfather, 2001, Shawshank ect. I think this is the best Nolan film, I think he truly made his magnum opus here and I can't wait to see if and or when he trys to top this. This is also probably the best true story I've ever seen adapted. Cillian was oscar worthy and should receive best actor for how his eyes carried so much weight in this film.

9.0,Nolan has done everything in Cinema!,usingitwhy,21 July 2023,We always believe Nolan's films are always confusing and mind boggling but the recent Oppenheimer is Nolan's one of the best work.Atomic Bombing & The Dialogues are the main theme for me..The buildup in the first half clearly wins the shows in second.Cilian Murphy is exceptional as always but Robert Downey Jr clearly gave his career best.Marvellous casting just added flavours to this dish.

If someone hates on this movie is because they did not understand the message and meaning behind it. Margot Robbie did an excellent job portraying Barbie. Would totally rewatch this movie. This movie made me laugh, cry, and made me think about my childhood. Its such a beautiful movie. Greta Gerwig is one of the best directors of this generation. Truly the best movie released this year. She even broke box office record for female directors. LOVE BARBIE AND EVERYONE SHOULD WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Barbie
7.0,"Pink Political Power is: Fun, Funny At Times, Deep, But Aggressively Weird",rgkarim,21 July 2023,"LIKES:The Setting: -It feels like a Barbie world in real life and captures the energy of the doll in all glory.-Plenty of accessories, the plastic feeling, and the toy like atmosphere with real life people is totally captured and super fun.-The real world is fine and does the job of acting as the second world, but it's really Barbie land that excels in the feeling of Mattel bringing it to life.The Plot's Originality: -Yes, much of it is predictable and familiar, but there is more to it than meets the eye -Barbie's plot is one part comedy, one part discovery, and one part political philosophy that sort of gives you a variety I wasn't expecting.-It may feel a little out there, but points for trying to be different and more advanced than many other stories have attempted.The Acting: -McKinnon may have been used too much, but I loved her in this film for the way her weirdness works for weird Barbie. Quirky, fun, a little bold, but that SNL line delivery that really works for delivering lines.-Rae is fine for when she is on screen. She's got a few dynamics that her monotone delivery works with what you got, but to get top bill/first bill doesn't make sense to me -Ryan Gosling works well int eh roles, and for his direction, a supporting actor role nomination feels good for me. He's clumsy, funny, hardcore silly, and it works for the ridiculous nature and tone of the movie.-And for Margot Robbie, the woman continues to knock the ball out of the park for how amazing she fits the role. She's sparkly, quirky, but has a range that she just brings. Gerwig brought some new elements out in terms of representation thought maybe not the Oscar performance like some call for.The Comedy At Times: -The movie does have general jokes that worked very well for me, well timed moments that were perfect for breaking the moment.-Satire, to a point, was amazing at times at how much fun they had with certain concepts. The design of Barbie dolls that failed, or the fact of fashion drawing eyes, and even certain trends that we love. It was clever, balanced, and had this timing delivery that worked.-Some of the Ken lines were funny, the fact that I was like classic Patrick from SpongeBob was very fun, especially when sometimes paired with one of the other style of jokes.-And Helen Mirren's narration was the funniest component for me. Her dry delivery, the classy sass, and the fact the woman just sells the lines was my favorite part in terms of laughs and wished there had been more.-As such, the comedy did work at times for me.The Pace: -It's two hours long, but for the most part doesn't feel it and that goes to the fun pacing.-Barbie starts out fun, exciting, and pops into the adventure with a lot of energy.-Then that energy sort of stays, but hunkers down a bit, never losing the whimsy, but finding a means to feel entertaining and somewhat engaging.-That is the superior quality of this movie compared to the other big one, that engaging pace and just having fun.The Music: -By far, the music is what works the best for me in this movie and tells so much and brings so much energy in the track list.-The songs from the radio and the past work well, comedic devices that were quite honestly some of the best jokes for me with several of the characters.-Other songs are fun musical numbers that work, dance numbers full of pop vibe, or later a true stage show musical that had the theatrics and jazz of a stage show.-As for the new songs that were made for the movie, they were my favorite. Remixes of Barbie girl, an exposition song and reprise, and a few other numbers just have so much character that it really added points for me in terms of just how much fun Barbie can be.The Message: -There is a very deep message to this movie, and to be honest... I did enjoy this part of Gerwig's writing.-It's deep, has character development and really drives home a lot of social commentary and trends under the microscope about human qualities. I liked how it was built in, and the dialog to embrace it, and just wished this movie had kept that in line with me.DISLIKES:The Fun Vibes Take a Detour: -I just said the pace was good and there was an energy, but... the fun part did take a detour the further you went into the film.-Gerwig is a very ""unique"" writer and once she got her hooks into her political writing, there were times where the first part of the film's fun was lost to very agenda heavy writing.-I t felt a bit forced for me, and I longed for more numbers, a little adventure, and a little less banter/beating the dead horse that the film went.-Throw in the darker aspects of the agenda, and losing that fun at the beginning was not what I would have liked to see for most of the movie.Gerwig's Hyper Agenda -I get this is who she is, but I've seen movies where that side of her is toned down and we get a much deeper character drama.-But Barbie... Barbie pulls no punches and berates you with very in your face, no holds bar, rather excessive and in some cases insulting humor that I got tired of.-There were times where that line was perfect and the story quality maximized, but most of the movie failed that balance and she did not seem sorry for what I felt was a tad too toxic for my liking.-If you are a fan of this type of hyper writing, then you are in great shape, but for those like me who are tired of movies becoming agenda venting, this movie is going to lose points for being annoying and simplistic and losing the creative spark.The Stupidity: -The movie has a smart writer and so seeing so much ridiculous silliness in one movie to contradict the smart writing didn't accomplish much for me.-Will Ferrell's direction was one of these moments where he was a straight up idiot, saying weird things that were more awkward and uncomfortable than funny for me. His little montage was just really dumb and to the point it stuck out a bit too much.-Meanwhile, Ken's handling was fine being a moron, but Gerwig's political writing sort of didn't do much for me as rather than improving and becoming elevated like his counterpart, sort of grew toxic level stupid.-That excessiveness again just doesn't work when I saw those sparkling moments that show where everything comes together, instead of feeling like an adult version of a Disney Channel Original movie.The Character Usage is odd: -The movie is trying to balance a lot of names and characters and it only works on that half of the time.-Barbie has too many characters, and some of the people I expected to have more time, were limited than I anticipated and quite honestly a political tool.-They do their work, but, it's just missing balance and full use and I think it's relying too much on a sequel and people just happy with being comedic props and line spewers than anything else.The Story Is All Over The Place: -My fellow reviewers are right, it's a weird story and it is all over the place.-This might give it the unique twist, but Barbie's tale is a jumble of lots of different feels and theatrics that sort of work together, but feel messily put together.-One level is like I said fun, bright, and feels like a dance party meets on stage musical that works to an extent.-The second then becomes this dive into the psyche mixed with somehow comedically stupid gimmicks to try and keep entertaining going -Third then goes metaphysical and really deep, and it kind of works, but then goes really odd and sort of trippy, to a way I'm still trying to process.-Gerwig's writing is always deeper and more complex, but this might have tried to be a bit too ambitious for its own good for me and felt just so scrambled and very much in your face for plot telling.The VERDICT: Barbie is a venue that I really did have some fun with and was surprised by the unexpected things it had to offer and the clever writing I had hoped would shine in. A geek like me knowing the references, appreciating the pokes to it, and the fun timing of some well-written lines that had me laughing in the theater. I loved the acting, loved the set, and just loved a lot of the vibes of the less agenda writing really worked for me and will appeal to many of the general group. And the music, whew, really loved it and the energy and storytelling it did which was very good for me. But the movie did not appeal to me in that Gerwig seemed to reach too high for being unique and ""elevated"" leading to moments that just don't appeal to a reviewer like me. The detour of fun for very politically heavy writing was probably my least favorite aspect, losing the killer vibes and balanced fun and humor with a very polarized way of thinking was not my cup of tea. In addition the story elements and character usage felt a bit jumbled, scrambled, shallow, and having too many character moments to really show off Gerwig's better writing. Thus, when balancing this out, my score for this movie is that it's a theater worthy film for a lot of groups and dates. The score is:Adventure/Comedy/Fantasy: 7.5-8.0 Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0.",Barbie
5.0,"Not worth it, you will know it is just a hype",vishalchand1987,21 July 2023,"Hello...I did not watched it in IMAX cause in my city it wasn't available. But I had some better hope in respect of visuals and a powerful story. 2 mins of explosion was great but visuals weren't so impressive after and before that, I mean nothing unusual and story ah..a very very very ordinary story. A very normal story and the plot we have seen many times in many movies.So if you are going with some great expectations which I had you will not be satisfied and it is not the thing you are looking for.Music as usual good as u expect in Nolan movie but one tune was same like every movie of Nolan you will find it.But in the end I want to say that I was not expecting that shallow movie.

It offers many laughs and has a lot of hidden jokes which add up to a great movie. I was worried there would be much too many musical scenes, but after watching it I believe they were put there with good reason and in just the right places. The whole scene nearing the end of the film (I won't spoil anyhting, don't worry) was just so well done, I loved that the play on women-male dynamics was very lighthearted, but just serious enough. There is apsolutely no men-bashing.The Ken's were put in the women's places from the Real World and men in the theatres watching saying that the movie is 'too feminist' and is 'men-bashing' are failing to see their hypocrisy.",Barbie
8.0,A Fiery Fusion of History and Drama!,devamsonigra-14407,27 July 2023,"This movie is quite different from Nolan's usual style. As the title suggests, it primarily focuses on Oppenheimer's life rather than the anticipated nuclear blasts. The highly hyped nuclear blast scene didn't meet the grand expectations, though it did create some tension for a short while.Instead of being a typical blockbuster, the film leans more towards a documentary and courtroom drama, exploring historical events and personal stories. Viewers should manage their expectations accordingly. With a three-hour runtime, it requires a certain level of commitment from the audience, making it essential to have a good understanding of physics and history to fully appreciate the film and avoid potential boredom.",Oppenheimer

Right from the opening scene, the movie captivated us with its breathtaking cinematography and mesmerizing soundtrack, which heightened the emotional depth of each moment. Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer was nothing short of exceptional, as he brilliantly conveyed the inner conflict and moral dilemmas faced by the scientist during his involvement in the Manhattan Project.The screenplay was intelligently crafted, seamlessly blending historical accuracy with moments of artistic liberty, resulting in a gripping narrative that kept us on the edge of our seats throughout. The film not only explored the scientific aspect of Oppenheimer's work but also delved into his personal life and the profound impact his choices had on the world.",Oppenheimer
6.0,Pinkland,jack_o_hasanov_imdb,26 July 2023,"This movie is an excellent marketing product. Cinemas were full, Even in Baku city. It was very difficult to find tickets. People dressed in pink clothes were coming to this event. I wore my black shirt and went. I think the movie was not good. I fell asleep in some scenes. There were lots of boring speeches. The movie was fun, that's obvious, but I didn't laugh much. This movie became one of the most different and crazy events of our day. I don't think it has any value as a movie. It was indeed a bad movie, but as an event it was fun. I don't regret. There were some references. I liked most of them. The acting wasn't bad, I think it was good. I was getting bored again near the end of the movie. Anyway, I think it was a crazy and fun event, but it was a bad movie.",Barbie
2.0,No plot or context!,magpiehepburn,25 July 2023,"Massive fan of Margot Robbie but she is so much better than this.....From the get go, this film has no context and just looks like it was rushed together. It certainly has some funny parts but there are few and far between. The film centres to much around a fake world and not enough in the ""real world"". There is also to many rude references which to be honest, weren't necessary. I get it a 12A but surely they knew many of us would be bringing kids along.It was not a fun ride and will be one film that I will be forgetting about quite quickly. Potential was there but the storyline wasn't. Disappointed!",Barbie
4.0,Really disappointed,beastyfrog,29 July 2023,"Looking at the review I was really excited to go and watch this movie.I shouldn't have bothered! So many historic fact missing, so did they not get radioactive effect from watching the explosion in the US of course they did never showed or mentioned, little mention of the impact on Hiroshima but no details, once again a film that portrays government has coward and need scapegoat to justify their actions, one question is how can you be Jewish and communist?Who cares about the love story and the cheating, it wasn't that relevant to the story.I had high expectations it didn't deliver I feel cheated.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Creation and Destruction,aherdofbeautifulwildponies,26 July 2023,"Oppenheimer (2023), directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Cillian Murphy in the titular part, is that rare production where everything - everything - works.J. Robert Oppenheimer (called Robert, called 'Oppie', never called Julius) is the central figure of a story that is larger than any person; the heart of which beats at the temperature of approximately 300,000 degrees Celsius; the successful resolution of which threatens to swallow the world. Making a film that doubles as a biography of the atomic bomb and of its 'father' is a tall order, yet Nolan does the subject justice.Covering the expanse of thirty-seven years, from 1926 to 1963, the picture presents a non-linear sequence of events. The narrative moves to and fro between two hearings: that where the matter of Oppenheimer's security clearance is debated; and that where Lewis Strauss () is to be confirmed by the Senate as Secretary of Commerce. The latter plot-line may be unexpected, but it serves to expose the political machinations at work and, ultimately, links Oppenheimer's roles as a scientist and laboratory director to his personal life and his legacy.The performances by Murphy and Downey Jr. Are outstanding, with the rest of the ensemble cast (, , et al. Et al.) shining in their parts. Damon, in the role of General Leslie Groves, the officer directing the Manhattan Project, provides a welcome foil for Murphy's Oppenheimer, with the two sharing some of the best dialogue in the film. Pugh and Blunt, in the roles of Oppenheimer's lover and wife respectively, are striking and memorable in their own right.The cinematography by Nolan's frequent collaborator effortlessly oscillates between the minute and the colossal. The decision to forego computer-generated special effects - in favour of practical methods and recreation of historical settings - lends the picture authenticity that is rare in the CGI-saturated world of Hollywood blockbusters. The original score composed by is the nerve of the story, skilfully guiding the audience from 'the highest high, to the lowest low'.Oppenheimer is a work of cinematic art. It may deal with one of the darkest chapters in American history, yet its effect is that of profound enlightenment, of an experience surpassing one's immediate life, of an immersion into a world that is supranatural, arranged, distilled, concentrated - yet real. It is best seen at a theatre; perhaps, multiple times at that.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Accumulation of 25 years of movies,osvaldrustad,24 July 2023,"This movie is probably one of the best movies I have seen in recent times and is going up there with movies im going to rewatch the rest of my life.First of all the life of an amazingly complicated man is super hard to portray in 1 or even 2 hours. If you look at the 3 hours as long before watching this movie, dont worry. I thought the same thing, I figured it would be a slow paced movie like an in-depth character study. But this movie caught me off guard. Christopher Nolan has paced this movie expertly, it is suprisingly fast paced at times, but it still takes it time to explore Oppenheimer's mind.Cillian Murphy was born to play this role, he expresses so much with just one look alone. All the actors in this just feel perfect and they all shine when on screen. There is not a singel person who feels ""out of place"": Nolan even took some chances with some lesser known actors like Norwigain actor Trond Fausa who plays a Ukrainian explosians expert. This is truly an Oscar-worthy preformance by the whole cast and from Nolan.What really sealed the deal on this movie was the soundtrack by Ludwig Göransson. He shined when making music for Disney for shows like The Book of Boba Fett and The Mandalorian. The score for openheimer is truly his lifes work. The score ""Can you hear the music"" gave me goosebumps every time it plays.This is a breathtaking movie, but I would recommend doing some degree of research before watching. There is a lot of talking and if you go inn blank on who Oppenheimer is you might get lost at some point.Lastly I want to mention the one thing keeping this from a 10/10. The mixing of the music and dialouge is awkward at times. I watched this with my father and he asked me multiple times throughout the movie what was said. It can be hard to hear what they say at times. But this is merely a technical issue and the cinematography and music and acting makes up for it easily.",Oppenheimer
9.0,A film that truly lives up to the hype,ethanbresnett,26 July 2023,"A Barbie movie helmed by Greta Gerwig starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling... what could possibly go wrong? Practically nothing it seems, as this movie is a complete knock out in every possible way.It is hilarious from start to finish with a sharply funny, meta, intelligent script that is matched by the masterfully executed physical comedy.The story is emotional and powerful and meaningful which I did not expect, but this proved to be such a vital and welcome part of the film.The entire cast is brilliant with outrageously camp performances from them all, but the highlights are the two leads. I can't think of two better people suited for the roles than Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. They both give perfectly flawless performances, filled with heart and humour and charisma. Will Ferrell is a scene-stealer with some hilarious comedy as you'd expect, and America Ferrera delivers a great performance with a lot of heart.The visuals are so fun from the sets through to the costumes. It is such a vibrant and colourful film that bursts with creativity, and to top it all off it has a superb soundtrack as well.If you were once a Barbie movie sceptic like me, then think again as it does not disappoint!",Barbie
7.0,"Awkward, brilliant, anti-popcorn movie",grinningelvis,27 July 2023,"The most surprising thing about Barbie is that the joke gets old so quickly. Then, after it stops beating the audience over the head with its obviousness, it settles into a self-assured groove. It's the rare case in which the third act is actually better than the first two. The jokes land harder once it sheds the need to be all things at once - a twist neatly mirroring the film's central crisis moment.As it plays out, the first half of Barbie is surprisingly drab. It's a feat of production and winking self reference that threatens to turn into a painful civics lesson and a generic every-genre-all-at-once lecture. It's not nearly as weird or jarring as it needs to be, and ultimately, the Barbie world is as lifeless as the titular character.But then, something interesting happens: Barbie actually starts landing some punches. It's no accident that a turn happens with the introduction of a fairly obvious twist - the introduction of a strange character played by Rhea Perlman. And Perlman is the perfect actress to fill such a role. She's small, unglamorous, and crone-ish, consistently cast as either a venomous tough or as a matronly sieve. In Barbie, she's a literal chorus, and her existence in the film suggests a knowing concession between the Corporate Barbie toy empire and the relationship that so many women have with her, and themselves.These are the topics that have long churned in Noah Baumbach's films combined with topics that have defined Gerwig's features, yet the movie doesn't work like anything the two have accomplished separately. Barbie feels like Ladybird by way of The Life Aquatic, and when it allows itself to go full-blown existential, it manages a sort of cinematic brilliance that it's rival blockbuster (Oppenheimer, of Oppenheimer, looming so large over everyone's attempt at pretension) simply can't manage. The film has deep flaws, but heart is not one of them.It's a magical thing to see Margot Robbie cry, and while her performance really isn't particularly consequential to the plot, it does present emotional heft to a screenplay that is both dullard and brilliant by design. Robbie, like Charlize Theron, is a beautiful blonde archetypal actress who just happens to be profoundly intelligent and intense, even when the film literally mentions exactly how we are not supposed to look at her as ""average"" while begging us to see her as just that. It's a neat trick to pull off a genuinely flattering disrobing of stereotypical beauty. It's a joke Robbie is in on, and a passive exclamation point that co-star Ryan Gosling owns.I like watching actors having fun onscreen. I actually never expected to experience this in Barbie, especially when it shoehorns in less-than interesting roles for Will Farrell and Kate McKinnon and quickly exhausts its post-subtlety messaging. Farrell and McKinnon are supposed to be two anarchical characters. Both fall flat. We've seen it all before, and here they lack any acidity whatsoever. Their roles feel tired after countless Toy Storys and Lego Movies treading on the politics of child/adult expectations of reality. They almost seem like add-ons from the corporate execs they lampoon - especially troubling in that McKinnon is supposed to represent anarchy. But Robbie and America Ferrera eat up the screen, both inhabiting a particular idea that seems to have genuinely spring from Gerwig's best instincts. There are scenes that - in an overwrought and exaggerated cinematic world - seem to actually exist in real life. To get caught by surprise seemed impossible as the first act ground to a halt.Barbie is a little too blunt for its own good, which strangely ends up being a good thing. At just under two hours, the bludgeoning messaging stops being funny and you feel the fatigue that we're supposed to understand is the source of Barbie's angst. In that, the ending isn't a reach so much as a confident nod to where Gerwig has taken the audience. If it's rare to see a actresses having fun in a Hollywood film, it's especially rare to see a female director genuinely flourishing by being just exactly who she is.",Barbie
9.0,Masterpiece,elizaakash,23 July 2023,"What a splendid movie the whole 3 hours i watched it never felt like going out of the theatre the atmosphere created by the movie was so majestic..Loved cillians acting n RDJs, and ofcourse Christopher nolan the brilliant director behind all this .. The way the movie portrayed Oppenheimers character is just wonderful the making of atomic bomb the consequences he imagined after wards and the fear of having bloods in his hands the corrupt system of being jealous of another's work and forcing to work into it more false accusations on Oppenheimer by lewis strauus..you won't regret watching this movie.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Oppenheimer sits alongside the best films ever made,daddymojo,21 July 2023,"Oppenheimer, the film from Christopher Nolan has usurped Russians from Dream of the Blue Turtles as the leading edge of cultural awareness for ""father of the atomic bomb"". In that song, Sting flippantly introduced the subject as ""Oppenheimer's deadly toy"". In reality his relationship was much more complex with nuclear weapons than that; but kudos to Sting for introducing a name to millions of folks who otherwise wouldn't have heard it until now. Oppenheimer is a big film in the most Christopher Nolan manner possible. It's a three-hour dramatic tour de force that grabs viewers by their shirt collars and maintains its grip for the vast majority of its run time.Unlike Nolan's other works, Oppenheimer is driven by dramatic sequences, tight dialogue, and acting that's top-notch. There aren't any big action sequences, but viewers who want a breathtaking overview of the Atomic Bomb, its creation and after-effects will be mesmerized. That's all the more amazing because there are about two dozen characters as the film jumps between a 20-year era in history. Those characters are all memorable and their role in Oppenheimer's life and work are always clear, unless they aren't.This is a Christopher Nolan film after all, and some scenes are truncated or have certain lines of dialogue not audible. Those lines or scenes will be seen later in the film, but only when they need to be shown in order to crystallize plot threads. Nolan also uses black and white film to contrast the setting, tone, timing and perspective of the story in a near-perfect manner. There's a reason why some scenes are in color and others aren't. Some characters are shown in a flashback in black and white, then immediately shown in the current story in color, or vice versa. When you see the film, this effect is akin to a chess match that the characters are having.As a film, Oppenheimer is very difficult not to look at. There are dozens of scenes that were filmed close-up, with the minute details of the actor's faces or bodies filling up the screen. And because this is a character-driven film, there are many more opportunities for people to fill the scenes than Nolan's other works.The first act of the film is more of an artistic painter's approach to Oppenheimer as a person, than a traditional movie. There are short, chaotic cuts and close-ups of Cillian Murphy interspersed with micro close-ups of the stages of explosions, reactions and wires that are reacting to electrical charges. This part of Oppenheimer focuses on his early educational life as the background, but it's being presented in hindsight because he is currently being questioned by a Congressional panel.He's a very gifted student who is well-networked, but also mischievous, too direct at times and keenly aware that he's usually the smartest person in the room. As a teacher, he wants to engage in theoretical physics and the concept of energy relating to collapsing stars and the blackness of space. He is also very open-minded, even to those with radical ideas on campus. Because of this, he makes numerous friends in a school communist organization, which unfortunately comes back to haunt him.The classroom next to his is working on a machine that will research, and hopefully split, atoms. As the world's drumbeats to WWII get louder his classes get bigger and his knowledge of physics gets more useful.The world's top physicists have been captured or are working with the Nazis. When they make a key breakthrough in nuclear power Oppenheimer realizes that the world is racing towards weaponizing this new technology. The lab next to his classroom is able to replicate what the Germans did and he's given the chance to form his own team.Oppenheimer teams up with a U. S. General and they create their own research facility in Los Alamos. It's a city where they all live with their families and can conduct testing and research with minimal delay. The film does a great job of making the potentially incomprehensible process of nuclear reactions, bombs, and the science behind them something that non-tech folks can understand. When you see Benny Safdie as Edward Teller talking about a different delivery method for the bomb that could prove more efficient you're able to follow the logic.The success of the bomb's testing starts Oppenheimer's concerns about responsibly using that power. The end of WWII brings even more issues as he runs afoul of certain politicians, which results in his inquiry that started the movie.Oppenheimer is a powerful film that ranks alongside Schindler's List in terms of a war or combat film that will stand the test of time. It's impossible not to compare the two films in terms of quality and deftly telling a story to audiences that aren't familiar with its titular character. The final act of the film focuses on McCarthyism and communist hearing, where his past history, as well as that of his wife and peers, will resonate with folks today.Could you really be held accountable for one meeting that you had with someone a decade and a half ago? Your actions have always been solid, but those who seek you harm are focusing on that meeting or perhaps the beliefs of a second-tier associate. Could you really be held accountable just for RT something on social media? Your actions are solid, but those who don't think like you do will do anything to cause you harm. McCarthyism and the public's zeal to believe or jump on the bandwagon of those who said something on social media that runs counter to what they believe have much in common.Oppenheimer was an independent thinker who wasn't afraid to surround himself with people who question his work or beliefs. While the movie, Oppenheimer was indeed a fantastic piece of cinema, I hope that the irony of those who persecuted him isn't lost on all of audiences and the similarities that they might share.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Stunning experience,tdimitrovbg,21 July 2023,"Oppenheimer combines both stunning visual and audio experiences! From the beginning of the movie all till the end, you can find yourself on the edge of your seat. The way Christopher Nolan is able to capture the fear in the characters is uncanny. Cilian Murphy delivers extraordinary acting and I'm sure he will be up for an Oscar nomination. The fact that there is not one single shot of CGI further proves the fact of how amazing Nolan's directing is. The movie centers around the man and not the bomb and 3 hours of runtime went so fast no one actually felt it due to the grasp of the story. Thank you, Nolan, for delivering the story of the modern Prometheus in such a way!",Oppenheimer
4.0,Go se oppenheimer instead.,maxilundholm,26 July 2023,Even though gosling gives ken such of a good play. This movie was to peachy. Really not good in my opinion but it was a good movie to sleep to. And my five year old daughter was so happy to see the movie and she loved the popcorn. And the ending was amazing to be a bad movie. I'd say the movie is good in the beginning but it's still badly written and the plot isn't good enough to make a movie like this one or something else that I think is better in that regard and it's not that good at the same level of story but it still makes it a great film to see and see and it is worth a watch and I don't know if.,Barbie
9.0,Cillian Murphy. That is all.,Lk1990,24 July 2023,"Nolan simply does not miss.The only complaint I can think of for this film is that it's a tad too long. Other than that, it's basically a masterpiece.Every single performance is off the charts. Downey Jr. Surprised me the most with his dramatic and aggressive role. Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Florence Pugh were all fantastic as usual and didn't miss a beat anywhere in the runtime.It's Cillian Murphy however, that gives the most memorable, emotional, gut wrenching and insightful performance of the film. He is absolutely sublime. Watching him in this film made me proud to be Irish. Not only does he look like Dr. Oppenheimer, he sounds and moves just like him too. This will without a doubt be his defining role in the decades to come. He was quite literally perfect.Nolan is of course on the ball once again. The film looks amazing, sounds incredible and keeps the intensity throughout. There was one particular scene where I actually couldn't sit still. I was a sweating mess. But that's what films should do. They should take us to uncomfortable and difficult places and make us want more.This one will be remembered.",Oppenheimer
10.0,A cinematic masterpiece in every aspect,pranayjalvi,23 July 2023,"Nolan's Oppenheimer barely qualifies as a biopic, at least not the thudding Hollywood variety. Instead it's a movie - a masterful one, among his best - investigating the nature of power: how it is created, how it is kept in balance, and how it leads people into murky quandaries that refuse simplistic answers.The three-hour historical biopic Oppenheimer is a gorgeously photographed, brilliantly acted, masterfully edited and thoroughly engrossing epic that instantly takes its place among the finest films of this decade - an old-fashioned yet cutting-edge work that should resonate with film scholars and popcorn-toting mainstream movie lovers for years and decades to come. Although it might be boring to a certain group of audience, Oppenheimer is for everyone, except those who never dwelved much into the director's finest filmography and what he brings to the screen.Every character seemed like a mirror to their original counterpart while portraying them. Cillian Murphy was nothing less than being an absolute pleasure to watch. The biography fully embraces the contradictions of an intellectual giant who was also a deeply flawed man, his legacy complicated by his own ambivalence toward the breakthrough achievement that secured his place in the history books. Most mature film by the director with an already finest filmography throughout his career, Oppenheimer joins and becomes a distinctive feature, which feels different from Nolan's other movies (with regards to genre) while feeling the same on many aspects (with regards to direction, trademarks)My Rating : 10/10.",Oppenheimer
2.0,Out of control,jlnewps,26 July 2023,"I thought the plot was very out of control and did not have a way to end itself. Most scenes last 1-2 minutes too long and the ending is terrible. No resolve was ever made to the story which leaves. We have this whole movie about how both matriarchy and patriarchy are not perfect or good, but instead of leaning into that the movie ends with everything going back to how they were before. Politics aside, this movie had no clear goal in mind for the plot and it showed in a very convoluted mess. One positive is the set design and costumes were amazing. The actors were okay in this movies and flashes of comedy was shown, but most jokes are over used or just fall flat.",Barbie
10.0,The simplest complexity,faroukmohamed-32281,23 July 2023,Only Nolan can do this mix. When you talk about the atomic bomb and explain the complex physics of it's manufacturing in a such a simple way you have to be Christopher Nolan. But actually the movie is not about the bomb it's about the era of the world war and specifically the scientists and the conflict they suffered when one of the most revolutionary inventions turns into a lethal weapon that will kill hundreds of thousands or more. With the outstanding performance of cillian murphy as usual and the magnificent cast in every single role. The most surprising was Robert Downey Jr he was on fire the best role in his entire career so far. To sum up it's the perfect movie with the perfect director with the perfect cast with perfect soundtrack.,Oppenheimer
6.0,Disappointing Nolan,BirdzOfParadise,21 July 2023,"Having seen every single one of Nolan's films and considering him the G. O. A. T. I've been waiting for this movie for over a year. Sadly, I was left incredibly underwhelmed. It started slow and boring and stayed here pretty much the whole movie. There was nothing compelling that happened at all. I know it's as a biopic, but this is Nolan...and where some criticize Tenet for doing too much, he did far too little here. I did not feel emotionally connected to any of the characters, they did not develop the conflict he was alleged to have felt, it was so difficult to understand the actors at times due to low speaking, poor accents and ridiculously loud bursts of music and sound, and it was about 45-60 minutes too long with dialogue in many places that not progress the storyline in any substantive way nor was it interesting. The only thing that kept me awake as long as I did was that the movie jumps around between around 3-4 different time periods while telling Oppenheimer's story. But you could spend 30 min on Google and get the same information you get from this movie or watch any of then various documentaries out there and get more excitement.Was this a bad movie? No, not in the least. But the hype around this movie centered on 3 things: 1) Nolan, 2) His take on Oppenheimer, and 3) The start studded cast. Only the latter delivered, and having seen the movie I now understand why so many A and well liked B list actors were needed.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Perfection,parkercblair,23 July 2023,"The duality of being perfect and yet still not being enough is portrayed so well here. This movie is about being able to relate to the constant evolution of the human condition, specifically in a way that centers growing up from being a naive child to being aware of yourself and the judgement of others. This movie does center women, but any individual claiming this movie is a misandrist anthem has no idea of even a notion to what the point of this movie was.Hilarious, intelligent, beautiful, poignant, tasteful. This movie makes me warm to the knowledge of being a woman. I will be watching more Greta movies from now on if not all of them. I cried.",Barbie
7.0,It was pretty good but not worthy of the hype,daniel-smits-03179,21 July 2023,"Barbie was an entertaining movie, but was definitely not worth the hype that accompanied the film. The messages the movie wanted to share were so on the nose and explicit that it became jarring and weird. The movie also meandered from place to place and didn't seem to have a purpose for the majority of its run time.Ryan Gosling was hilarious though and stole every scene he was in. Several of the cameos were also great.Had fun, but wouldn't really recommend it as a 'must watch'. Mostly watched it as the first part of the Barbenheimer meme, so it was worth it for that reason at least.7/10.",Barbie
1.0,A Tedious Snoozefest: ''Oppenheimer'' Misses the Mark,pusheennyankat,29 July 2023,"Where do I even begin with ''Oppenheimer''? This film was an absolute disaster from start to finish. I can't believe I wasted precious hours of my life on such a pretentious and uninspiring piece of cinema.First and foremost, the pacing of the movie was horrendous. It felt like the director was trying to bore the audience to death with excruciatingly slow scenes that seemed to go on forever. I found myself checking my watch every few minutes, praying for this never-ending ordeal to be over.The characters in ''Oppenheimer'' were as lifeless as cardboard cutouts. Despite the incredible historical significance of J. Robert Oppenheimer's life and the Manhattan Project, the filmmakers managed to suck all the excitement and intrigue out of the story. The protagonist's emotions were about as captivating as watching paint dry, and the supporting characters were so one-dimensional that I couldn't muster any empathy for them.Let's not forget the cringe-worthy attempts at romance that seemed shoehorned into the story without any real purpose. The love interest was so poorly developed that it felt like the actors were reading lines from a cheesy romance novel. It was painful to witness such forced interactions that added nothing to the overall narrative.Furthermore, the soundtrack was utterly forgettable, failing to enhance the emotional impact of pivotal moments in the film. A compelling score could have salvaged some of the lifelessness in the story, but alas, ''Oppenheimer'' didn't deliver on that front either.In conclusion, ''Oppenheimer'' is a colossal disappointment that squandered a fascinating historical subject with its meandering plot, lifeless characters, and overall lack of direction. Save yourself the agony and skip this snoozefest; Watch Barbie instead.",Oppenheimer
9.0,First experience,leonalfayetjr,20 July 2023,"This is the first film that I have watched in theaters, and I am very happy to know and feel the extraordinary viewing experience this film has presented.Overall, I get a view from the description of Oppenheimer's own living conditions, and this film is truly extraordinary and they can package it well.And my advice to audiences who want to enjoy this film well is that you can dig into Oppenheimer's history and what events happened at that time, or watch the documentary version first, which is ""To End All War: Oppenheimer & the Atomic Bomb (2023)"", to be honest even though at the beginning the film was ""Complicated"" and my friend fell asleep several times earlier, but I can understand it a little bit well, and by knowing more information about Oppenheimer you will enjoy this film well, you will gain cinematographic experience presentation, actor/actress expression, visual audio, etc. With extraordinary results.Thank you to all parties involved in making this film, my first experience watching it in a theaters was truly extraordinary and will be very memorable for me, good job guys.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Christopher Nolan reaffirms his place among the very best of all time.,bvillard,27 July 2023,"Wednesday, July the 19th. Opening night in Paris. The audience exits the crowded room in dead silence, having witnessed yet another masterpiece from the director who doesn't require any introduction. While being so typically Nolan, Oppenheimer also separates itself from the rest of his filmography. No Tenet-like action sequences, no mind-bending elements, no confusing timeline. The movie unfolds slowly but surely, and the 3 hours go by without being felt. The final hour in particular, might just be the best I've witnessed in a long time.As for the actors, the performances are as stellar as you could expect and probably have already heard. Cillian Murphy does an Oscar-worthy job at portraying a brilliant yet troubled Robert Oppenheimer, RDJ is (for the better) unrecognizable and delivers probably the most subtle and complex performance of his career. Emily Blunt oscillates between vulnerability and strengh masterfully, and the rest of the star-studded cast does an equally amazing job.When it comes to the soundtrack, Ludwig Goransson's work is superb. Powerful at times, it can also be very subtle, almost fading into the background noises. But when it comes back at the front of the stage, it will give the viewer goosebumps and sink him into Oppenheimer's internal struggle.Hindsight might be needed in order to properly judge this film, but it is my opinion right now that only The Prestige and Interstellar (maybe) surpass it in Nolan's work.",Oppenheimer
10.0,SO SO SO GOOD,lulubelle-38493,22 July 2023,"I loved this movie so much. It's so effortlessly funny with the end being heartfelt and quite sad. The soundtrack is amazing including one of my favorite songs by billie eilish ""what was i made for."" The song is so amazing and finishes off the movie in the best way possible.Barbie took a very unexpected turn of events that did not appear in the trailer (i think this is a good thing) and was full of plot twists that thickened the storyline.It is great for all ages and genders as it has a lot of relatable characters.Overall i think it is a movie to definitely add to your watchlist and go see in your nearest cinema!!",Barbie
5.0,One for the Identity Lost Generation,lukell-96155,22 July 2023,"Underneath the corporate irony and plate-spinning, there's a film that is mildly humorous; if not a tad lost with it's identity and message. A battle between feminism and stereotyping. Is this a film for young girls? I don't know, it feels as if it's wondered off the reservation. Is it a film for women - more than likely. There's heartfelt messaging at the curtain closing, but it very much straddles the fence between traditional conservative womanhood and progressive girl boss ""smash the patriarchy"".Speaking of patriarchy, this film drops the p-word countless times. And the image of masculinity is confusing, is Ken masculine or campy and confused? Horse obsessed, gym bro, with a passion for theatrics and fur coats - traditional masculine, doubtful.I don't know who this film was made for, or where it stands on anything.

Nolan masterworkMay be the best anxiety inducing music and claustrophobic inducing photography I ever witnessedYou feel all of the horror and the weight of guilt and emotions of Murphy , the score will hit your soul so hard like a bomb , you will be crushed under tension.Everybody waiting for bomb explode , but the bomb not the star , here , it was everything else in this movie may be the best biography movie I ever watchedThe cast did an amazing job portraying every characterI will not forget the early flickering light and atoms scenes in the beginning of the movie ,So goodI wish everyone enjoy this masterpiece as I did.",Oppenheimer
10.0,The American Promethus,TheVictoriousV,27 July 2023,"In the months leading up to Oppenheimer, two things were clear from the buzz surrounding it (beyond its relationship/rivalry/sisterhood with Barbie, of course): Christopher Nolan doesn't mess around with digital effects, and its sequence of the Trinity bomb test -- where J. Robert Oppenheimer is indeed ""become Death, destroyer of worlds"" as the Bhagavad Gita passage goes -- was said to be the most powerful and devastating movie scene you'll ever see in a theater, IMAX or otherwise. Conclusion: It seemed likely that this will be the first film to kill its viewers with either fire or radiation poisoning. Tread carefully.In all seriousness, Oppenheimer delivers all that it promises and then some. Its success will solidify the revitalization of movie theaters -- Nolan has long been one of the strongest advocates of theaters over home streaming, even with his controversial release of Tenet during the pandemic -- and its quality will do the same for audiences, who can't hope for this kind of experience in the living room unless they have a damn fine set-up. Most importantly, it solidifies that real movies are back on top, as opposed to... well, you know.Based on 2005's The American Prometheus, the film follows the development of the WWII Manhattan Project through various perspectives, some ""subjective"" and some ""objective"", denoted by shifts to black-and-white: the scenes in color show the truth as Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy in a career-defining performance) sees it and are wholly dramatized; the B/W ones are based more on what's documented in literature and court transcripts. It's not entirely linear either, yet there's never any question as to where in the timeline we're at, or who's telling their version of that moment.The rest of the cast is quite considerable. Figures significant to the Manhattan Project, its judicial aftermath, Oppenheimer's personal life, or all three are played (brilliantly) by the likes of Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh (who shares Murphy's prestigious honor of being the first actors filmed naked on 70mm IMAX), Emily Blunt, Benny Safdie, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, Jason Clarke, David Dastmalchian, and even Josh Peck if you can believe it. There are also actors that seem to have either been forgotten or laughed out of the movies that Nolan invites us to reconsider; Dane DeHaan, Josh Hartnett, and Alden Ehrenreich deliver some of the most memorable performances in the movie. Also look out for big names within the fields of math and physics -- quantum or otherwise (Oppenheimer meets with the likes of Heisenberg, Bohr, and even Einstein, with whom he shares some of his best scenes).The film has been rightly described as an intimate story about something massive. And in spite of its runtime and even its contents as such (it's a rather dialogue and character-oriented picture), it is a movie that feels energetic at every turn; through snappy editing and seminally used music and sound, Nolan has made a film whose talky, three-hour totality has the same intensity to it as the final act of any of his other productions. There are knowing glances and vital cutaways that will carry even greater weight on a second viewing.It knows precisely how much to show -- with regard to mass destruction -- and how much to leave to the imagination of its characters as well as us. One of the most striking moments is one in which a Republican statesman simply advises against dropping the Atomic Bomb on Kyoto. Why? Well, because he and his wife vacationed there one time.It's been pointed out that this quick exchange is far more effective a demonstration of the evil and callousness of American Imperialism than had they simply shown how the Japanese suffered as a result of the Hiroshima-Nagasaki strikes -- something that certain reviewers felt was ""missing"" here, but I'll get to that. (One notably funny complaint, however, came from Armond White, who of course thought Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was a better nuke movie and also brought back his ""Nolan's Joker caused the Aurora shooting"" spiel. My guy Armond is hilarious again; truly cinema is back.) Similarly, there's a scene of thunderous applause near the end -- shortly after JRO sees that he has made annihilation itself -- that has been described as ""scarier than any standard violent horror film"", and I tend to agree. Before the bomb itself is even detonated, Nolan manages to give it a most terrifying presence.Having said that, the primary reason to see this in a movie theater is, indeed, the Trinity launch. This sequence -- the heart-racing build-up, the detonation itself, and the tangible awe and despair that follows -- shook me to my core in a way that art hasn't done since Vishnu knows when. I thought for a moment that critics might be exaggerating the impact and subsequent dread of this moment, but I am prepared to argue that it is a paragon of audiovisual art and what it can do for us if we dare let it. JRO has a series of visions -- hallucinations of splitting atoms, dying stars, and other images of annihilation that he alone can truly perceive/fathom -- that also justify seeing this film in the largest possible auditorium with the best possible sound system, but that one scene is reason enough.Regardless, the rest of Oppenheimer is very much a ""Christopher Nolan presentation"" -- it is weighty, technically precise, meticulously told, and powerfully scored by Ludwig Göransson -- but the subject matter and the occasional shifts to monochrome have yielded comparisons to the political epics of Oliver Stone. Nolan has long been among those rare filmmakers whose name is enough to draw a crowd, and now, in an age where the slop that used to dominate the rest of the summer movie season is starting to lose people, he gets to make his masterpiece -- and we all came to see it.This, therefore, isn't just the best film of the year; it's one of the most important of its era.",Oppenheimer
6.0,Didn't match the expectations.,abhishekmnicolson,22 July 2023,"The internet created a huge hype about this movie. The Bomb and Nolan maybe the reason. In the movie, there was more dialogues (especially in the train which doesn't made any sense) than the making of the bomb. The cinematographer was descent and Nolan did well. Murphy carried the whole movie. There was some miscasts but overall an average movie. The bomb test was a great experience, didn't expected it. It was like a biopic and anyone cam enjoy the movie with proper knowledge about Oppenheimer. People may watch the movie more than one time to understand the storyline. Just have to say that people expected more from Nolan.",Oppenheimer
10.0,"A movie for everyone (yes, even men)",sustylery,23 July 2023,"I anticipated this movie long before it came out and already watched it twice in the cinema. Greta Gerwig managed to make our wildest Barbie-dreams come true and not only created some of the funniest comedy i've seen in a long time in a movie, but also made me agree so hard with every feminist message she put in the film. Messages that everyone needs to hear - even, or should i say, especially men.The performances where wonderful, particularly that of Ryan Gosling who really tapped into his Kenergy. I thought it was interesting to see that not only Barbie aka Margo Robbie got a character arc, where she got to grow up to become a woman. Also Ken aka Ryan Gosling underwent some significant character growth that I much appreciated.As the trailer said; If you love Barbie, you will love this film. If you hate Barbie, you will still love this film. Because it isn't only about a doll, but also about the patriarchal system we all have to deal with on a daily basis and about the complexity that is human life in general. Who would have thought a movie about Barbie could do such things?",Barbie

3.0,Too loud too long too much,diemarxens,22 July 2023,"We have talking, more talking, again talking, then a bomb and then again talking talking talking.Plus confusing time zone mix-ups, women characters who are next to nothing (kind of a trademark of CN), a soundtrack which is waaaay to much for this kind of biopic, a try to take all of his live into the movie and delivering next to nothing at all, a character study which isn't really one (since you don't know nothing about Oppenheimer by the end and what it did to him on a personal level) and you need to be prepared with his live before the movie otherwise you are missing to much.So in short: Not his best, not the masterpiece everyone wants it to be and the hype suggest. But please go and see it for yourself.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Barbie was much more than expected,codyfelix,24 July 2023,"Barbie was an extremely fun movie that was entertaining and funny throughout the entire runtime of the movie. The jokes were witty, funny, well-written and did not impede on the tone of any serious moments. Barbie was for sure targeted for kids but made for adults to enjoy just as much as the little ones. The casting was phenomenal, every actor embodied their character, Margot Robbie is dynamite in her role delivering every line with sincerity and real feeling. Ryan Gosling was the epitome of Ken, fun, and lovable but he was also able to sublimely deliver emotions that one would not associate with Ken. With 2 powerful stars you would think that the secondary characters would be unnoteworthy, but Simu Liu, and Will Ferrell command the screen so remarkably, not to mention every other Barbie and Ken, and Allen too. All of this without even mention the cinematography and the breathtaking music which culminates into a delightful story that impressively tackles pretty serious issues.",Barbie
9.0,Phenomenal Account Of The Most Important Part Of Human History,philiptballas,23 July 2023,"Few inventions throughout the history of mankind have been of more consequence than the creation of the nuclear bomb. Robert Oppenheimer is one of few men who single-handedly changed the course of history. This film did a great justice to his legacy.Christopher Nolan masterfully throws you into the world of 1940s theoretical physics and the lives of these incredibly brilliant scientists, under the backdrop of the most important contest of all time - the race to build the atom bomb. Oppenheimer leading America, Heisenberg leading Germany. For all of the moral dilemmas explored in the film, the bottom line is that if America didn't succeed, our adversaries very well would have. Dropping Little Boy and Fat Man on Japan may have killed hundreds of thousands, but Oppenheimer's work and campaigning may have saved millions and billions over the course of time.The historical accuracy was incredible, and it was electrifying to see the portrayal of these great minds of science and the choices they were faced with. From the start of the movie, we see Oppenheimer portrayed as a savant that sees a dimension of the world out of reach to the common man, reminding me of John Nash in A Beautiful Mind.We see the massive investment that went into the Manhattan project, and how much freedom and power FDR gave in the form of a blank check to these scientists, trusting in their process - Hitler, on the other hand, never had the same conviction or investment on the German side. Cillian Murphy gave an Academy award winning performance as the lead role, and was supported by countless terrific performances by other A-list actors.I am astounded by the amount of effort Nolan invested into the history and science of this film, while still keeping the pace captivating and thrilling. Really outstanding movie, and a refreshing break from the many action-packed, superhero type of movies that drive the box office today. I hope there will be more blockbuster films like this in the future.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Cillian murphy and Christopher Nolan,freegame-calin,21 July 2023,"For the first time when Cillian Murphy remains in history for the interpretation of a real character in a Hollywood film and the second memorable character after Tommy Shelby.Christopher Nolan opens up the possibility of a new cinematic era. A Hollywood wave in which DC and Marvel films will be left behind to make way for modern films, based on real and powerful stories, with historical importance. Besides the fact that the film becomes one of Nolan's best works, J. R. Oppenheimer is found even today, the Russian-Ukrainian war and recent threats with nuclear warheads.""They won't fear it until they understand it. And they won't understand it until they've used it."" The main reason why in today's modern days people live in peace with a world order and rules against the use of atomic energy is the very fear of a mass destruction of the population. Fear, which did not exist among the countries before the Hiroshima and Nagasaki disasters.At the same time, Japan benefited from the traces of capitulation and American aid, the latter even involved in the reconstruction of the constitution and the implementation of democratic politics, becoming a main partner of the United States of America. Thus, nowadays, we can love Japan with all its brands, leaving behind the horrors and massacres committed by the Japanese during the period of imperialism.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Downright amazing,cowboysmavs,24 July 2023,"One of the best movies of all time. To start, Christopher Nolan did a phenomenal job at forming the movie and how he revealed certain secrets. He spent lots of time developing Oppenheimer and just the right amount with other characters such as Lewis Strauss. The cinematography was on a whole different level. Definitely Oscar worthy. Different colorings for different time periods was a very smart choice, and it helped me understand the movie a lot better. During a scene with yelling, the contrast got a lot brighter like a bomb detonating;). You can also see objects shaking in the background the louder it gets. The acting by everybody, even a character who was in one scene storming out of a room, was amazing. Cillian Murphy was the perfect casting choice for a character like Oppenheimer. He conveyed the emotions extremely well and is definitely deserving of at least an Oscar nomination. Nolan really outdid himself and all the hype paid off. I have one slight criticism and that is that there was a very brief period of time near the beginning of the movie that seemed to move a little bit fast but since the movie was 3 hours, it didn't bother me very much. All in all, movie of the year, decade, and maybe even century. Don't believe me? Go watch it and you're sure to be speechless as soon as the credits roll.",Oppenheimer

I felt like it was like 3 stories all in one movie and they shifted to those stories really fast. I did like the feminist vibe because it was all without hating on men.

It is Nolan's most subtle and poingnant work may be his best I don't know. The film doesn't rely on heavy breathing spectacle like Nolan's previous works,it is pure drama and everyone must watch it in the biggest possible screen.

Wish other actors had been to the same school. It is probably a much better film than i experienced, the visuals are stunning and ther is some science mingled with the human stories.

But make no mistake, there is purpose and feeling to the film. It presents its core message boldly around its character's struggles, and subtly beneath its self-referential humor.I could best describe Barbie as the inaugural Marvel movie of Greta-Gerwig-involved projects. It has a fantastic ensemble all-star cast with added cameos you never saw coming. Dazzling VFX and detailed practical set pieces bring life to the most plastic aspects of Barbieland. At several points it not just breaks the fourth wall, but blows through it altogether. There is no moment where it won't reset your expectation about what will come next.There are definitely characters and relationships I would have liked to see explored more in-depth in the film. Regardless, Barbie will send you home with a profound motivation to re-explore who you are, where you're headed, who you want to be.",Barbie

6.0,"Irregular Narration, Fast Paced, Ok Visuals and a Great Camerawork. It's Neither Boring, nor Great.",crazymanlife6,22 July 2023,"I will keep my review very simple and absolutely honest.The movie is a biopic in its purest sense. Don't watch this movie if you think the Trinity test will be spectacular with great special effects. Nolan tried to achieve the blast with practical effects and that took a major toll on the seriousness of how violent Nuclear explosion can be. Basically there is only one explosion people go to the watch the movie. If someone is telling me they watched the movie just for the Dr. Oppenheimer's pov of life, I would say they are lying to themselves. Everyone on this planet have some philosophy of their own and a sob story. Oppenheimer's doesn't make him any special or more vulnerable than us. That's the essence of life.I did not go to the movie expecting it to be an action flick. Also just because I am a long time Nolan fan doesn't mean I can lie to myself convincing that's it's a spectacular movie. The movie is just blant. Over 90% of the movie is distracting with its cutting and showing different timelines while lacking consistency in story telling. Nolan is know to cut scenes and show past and future back to back without giving the audience gap to breath. This style of screenplay will work only for some movies but not all. I totally understand why Nolan had to do what he did, but it simply didn't workout that well.I am from India, and usually I know when it's a great movie by seeing our Audience reaction. 70% of the seats were full and I thought people would usually blast the theatre with screaming like monkeys do, like we do in all good movies. But this time, I watched a soul-less, exhausted audience. Most of them were not even bothering to stay and give the movie some attention.The other thing I want to talk about it's the sound track. As gorgeous it can be, it's frustrating and irritating to see Nolan using the same Dunkirk theatrics like the playing the foot stomping rail track sound again and again. To summarise what I saw1. A loud monotonous eerie sound track.2. Characters yelling half the time to make the movie look serious.3. A failed Trinity explosion practical effects.4. Too much screentime about the protagonist AEC hearing and potential indictment. (Honestly, who in this day and age would give a damn about how the guy who made the atom bomb coped with Govt Committees for a stupidest reason that he could be potential Communist? I mean, how could the director think people who are watching the film know how big of a deal it is to talk communist ideas in a Capitalistic nation during WW2?)5. An unapologetic scientist in real life, which the movie did a fantastic job to not give a F or care about him and why he had to do what he had to do. Nolan literally failed to make me feel sorry for Oppenheimer. Just, seeing him read a BS sankrit phrase, ""Now I become death, destroyer of worlds"" is meant to convince he is really sorry for killing 210000 people?6. A movie which seriously lacks flow of story telling.7. A 3 hours, loud, serial type of drama.Atleast to do some justice to the people who are about to watch this movie, I would say, try to learning the names of the characters in Oppenheimer's life and how influential they too are. This movie is not for an Average Joe with zero knowledge about scientists and their respective contributions. And the way Nolan introduced them like a high speed train into the movie is seriously bad.All in all, it's a good movie, but not spectacular.",Oppenheimer
6.0,Unnecessarily lengthy,ahamedfahimq,22 July 2023,"With great expectations, I went to watch this film, and returned home totally disappointed. Very much shallow plotted with so many people to remember. I don't prefer watching this at theater. Many of us intended to leave in the middle while the movie was running. To me, it is a overhyped movie. However cinematography and casting were good. I expected better from Mr. Nolan. This movie could have ended within 1 hour and 20 minutes. At this point of time, movies should have had some points which will hook the audience. But I did not find anything like that in this movie. I should have watched Barbie instead. Nevertheless, best of luck.",Oppenheimer
7.0,Well crafted and intriguing peak into history,ta-98251,24 July 2023,"A very well crafted and intriguing look into the man who changed the world forever but it's not for everybody...As a fan of Nolan and of all things history, I was excited to watch a film about J Robert Oppenheimer and prepared for it not to be a typical Nolan Movie. Whilst this is masterfully created and feels great in IMAX, it's not a movie that will resonate with everybody especially those who aren't interested in the subject matter.Oppenheimer is a character study into the thoughts of the so called 'Father of the Atomic Bomb' leading up to the Manhattan project prior to when the atomic bomb was created and its aftermath when Oppenheimer had a bigger but different voice within the atomic energy scene.I enjoyed insight into the world of a Theoretical Physicist and the dynamic between the science community and that of the US Army. Whilst this isn't a science based film that goes heavy into the detail, we did get to see Oppenheimer's rise through the field and several interesting discussions with his peers. We also get an insights into his personal life. Like many geniuses, he had a few skeletons in his closet.The acting from Cillian Murphy and Robert Downy Jr was immerse as was most of the performances from the supporting cast. The sounds design was excellent and the testing of the atomic bomb was my favourite scene followed by the hearings. However my favourite part of the movie was Ludwig Goransson's dark, scientifical score. There were so many scenes where you felt the score elevating the mood or tension.This movie is not for everybody. Whilst I enjoyed the movie and was especially intrigued by how Oppenheimer was viewed by those around him. It's a three hours long dialogue heavy character piece that I wouldn't necessarily recommend to all of my friends. I didn't find it slow but there are parts that are slower than others and viewers that aren't interested in the subject matter or who miss story beats may struggle to stay on board or remain invested. Whilst this isn't my favourite Nolan film, it's masterfully made and an intriguing, insightful work into a man who changed the world forever.",Oppenheimer

The ""this movie is not for me"" means that you maybe are close minded, if you go to see anything with prejudice, you will more likely not enjoy it. I think it is fair if it isn't your cup of tea but don't review bomb the movie, there nany famous movies that are not for me but i don't think they are bad.

I felt the movie fell short of not preaching to me and spreading a message of division rather than unity. Men and women cannot survive without each other but you'd never know it watching this movie. And me having my 13 year old daughter with me almost caused me to walk out of the theater. I kept on waiting for the writers to hit the direction of unity but it never came. After the movie my daughter brought up the message to me saying how she even noticed the weird agenda they're trying to push and said that is not a movie for the easily impressionable.

It's full of a lot of emotion and great acting by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslin. These two were great and probably the best I've ever seen them act.

9.0,Critics Rave About 'Oppenheimer': A Brilliantly Layered Biopic,mendymariamKE,27 July 2023,"Initially, the prospect of enduring a 3-hour film raised doubts within me, contemplating how I could possibly remain engaged for such an extended duration. However, my uncertainty was swiftly dispelled.Directed and written by the renowned Christopher Nolan, the mastermind behind iconic films like ""The Dark Knight trilogy,"" ""Inception,"" ""Interstellar,"" and ""Dunkirk,"" ""Oppenheimer"" stands as yet another testament to Nolan's filmmaking expertise.This weekend, Cinephiles were in for a treat as two highly-anticipated films, ""Oppenheimer"" and ""Barbie,"" marked their much-awaited debut at the box office.""Oppenheimer"" has emerged as a remarkable biographical thriller, leaving audiences deeply engaged and intellectually stimulated throughout its ambitious 3-hour runtime.Based on the biography ""American Prometheus"" by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin, the film delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, brilliantly portrayed by the versatile and talented Cillian Murphy.Sharing the screen with Murphy are powerhouse actors Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr, Emily Blunt, and Florence Pugh.Upon entering the theater, viewers are immediately made aware that ""Oppenheimer"" demands their undivided attention.The film treats its audience with great respect, offering intelligent storytelling that requires one's wits and fully switched-on brain.Nolan masterfully crafts a dense and layered screenplay which fires dialogue packed with information at a relentless pace.The cinematography in ""Oppenheimer"" is visually arresting, presenting a stark and spare aesthetic while occasionally bursting with vivid and luscious colors, especially during scenes featuring the captivating Florence Pugh.The score, though beautiful at times, largely contributes to the film's pervasive sense of anxiety and oppression, perfectly complementing the relentless pacing that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats.While the 3-hour runtime might seem daunting to some, ""Oppenheimer"" surprisingly flies by.It is a must watch. I rate it 9 out of 10. Awesome.",Oppenheimer
1.0,Insensitive to masses,parthbagariya,22 July 2023,"""Oppenheimer"" is a film that attempts to explore the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the renowned physicist known for his involvement in the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. While the film may have had potential to shed light on an intriguing historical figure, it fails to do justice to its subject matter, resulting in a disappointing cinematic experience.One of the major issues with the movie is the inclusion of a controversial and inappropriate scene. During a sex scene, the actor is shown reading the Bhagavad Gita, a sacred Hindu scripture. This combination of intimate content with religious text displays a complete lack of sensitivity and respect towards religious beliefs. Such a portrayal is not only offensive but also unnecessary for the narrative of the film, adding nothing of value to the story of Oppenheimer's life.Despite having talented cast, film is an eye soreIn conclusion, ""Oppenheimer"" is a disappointing film with a rating of 1 out of 10. Its inappropriate and disrespectful portrayal of religious content that fails to leave a lasting impact. For those interested in exploring the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, it is recommended to seek out alternative sources that offer a more respectful and engaging depiction of this historical figure.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Ken out of ten,finnconnelly-63017,22 July 2023,"Wow. I did not see this masterpiece coming. And that's not a joke. Somehow, Greta Gerwig took Barbie, and made a movie that tackles some really tough social issues....well? It's crazy. But wow, does it work. The story is very mature, thinker of a plot. Once you're done laughing your butt off, you'll get really emotional. The production design is so on point. The whole movie is pink everything, but it's never polarizing. All the shades melt together in a very pleasing way. And of course the cast! Margot Robbie was born to play Barbie, and she hits a home run, but Ryan Gosling. This dude rocks as Ken. He knocked it all the way around the world and hit himself in the back of the head. He steals every scene he's in, and I would be so on board with a Ken spin-off. America Ferrara and Simu Liu are also great in their respective roles, but the cast overall is just perfect. Overall, Barbie is probably the best movie based off a toy (sorry LEGO Movies) and an overall fantastic time at the movies.",Barbie
10.0,Barbie with a life lesson,tylertubisjr,27 July 2023,"I was not expecting this movie to be great; I'm not into this kind of stuff, but still, I watched it, and man, it was great; some scenes are relatable to how people react to something nowadays, like, come on, everything and everyone can be cancelled, the overall acting of the cast is super great. I love it; almost all the song are catchy and complements the movie (like this song, by the way (Im just Ken)); the production set for this film is majestic, and parts of the movie are touching and somewhat relatable to our everyday life, and there can be something to learn from, very recommended to watch this with your whole family and friends.",Barbie
10.0,I know... A 10 rating is ridiculous.. but hear me out...,pie1003-791-709547,23 July 2023,"If you are expecting it to be so stupid ur gonna love it... Ur in the right place. I refused to watch extras and trailers, I wanted to be surprised. And I was! It's cheesey AF at first.. if u can get past 15 mins of everyone saying the name Barbie, you will survive this movie. In the beginning they ""flip"" through past Barbies and I seen quite a few that used to own.. they also ""flash"" through some barbie clothes that will bring u right back to childhood. For nastalgia sake this movie will not disappoint... For new comer's sake, this movie will not disappoint!

Jr! Respect for a master class on acting!Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer is a master class in film making by all means. Even an IMAX screen is not big enough to watch this achievement.",Oppenheimer
9.0,One of the best movies I've seen in years,jaimeematheson,23 July 2023,"I expected this to be a very good movie with some feminist undertones. It ended up being insanely funny, ridiculous, fun, and stupidly entertaining, yet highly topical and commentative. This movie hit on so many topics, patriarchy, capitalism, feminism, even misandry, yet managed to stay consistently funny and wild throughout. It never goes where you expect it to go but always defies expectations. The only reason I don't give this a 10 is for the small section of time where the feminism appears a bit too heavy-handed, and I can see where that would cause some male viewers to lose interest in the message. Other than that, this is the best movie I've seen in years and I can't see any topping it any time soon.",Barbie
7.0,Third hour was the best.,imdb-14761,30 July 2023,"I wanted to rate this higher, but it was a struggle to watch the first two hours. We saw this in a Regal RPX theater and the musical score was deafening. I don't know if others feel the same way but there were many parts where I didn't make out the dialogue. The jumping around between scenes combined with the booming soundtrack underneath made it extremely difficult for me to understand what was happening at all times. I'll have to watch this again, at home, with the subtitles on. That being said, the third and final hour of the movie absolutely blew me away. Wow. We already know Oppenheimer made the bomb. We know the bombs were used on Japan (and WHY didn't Nolan show us that!??) But the AEC security commission review ""trial"" and the Senate nomination hearings for Lewis Strauss (Robert Downey Jr's role) could have been a standalone movie all by itself and I loved it. I read a lot of people didn't like the third hour but I completely disagree. It's the other way around for me.",Oppenheimer
10.0,"10/10 amazing, a must see, not just a ""girly"" movie",sarah-82257,27 July 2023,"I thought the movie was amazing. Full of nuances.It is an incredible movie that goes in a completely different direction then I thought it would. I loved how they didn't shy from the perception of Barbie. Also, it was very well cast, the characters were all fantastic. This isn't just a ""girls"" movie, either! I absolutely loved it. I wouldn't change a thing. I laughed, I cried, I was entertained the entire movie. The jokes were intelligent and a bit edgy. It may look like a silly action adventure, but textured dialog and rapid-fire gags add important layers of meaning. Great actors - great way of portraying silly messages and wonderful way of getting the important messages out as well. The movie had a great combination of humor and message.As someone else wrote in an editorial ""superficial yet smart, caustic yet clever, and showcasing not just the very best but even the worst of all things Barbie. No stone is left unturned and no doll is left behind.""",Barbie

10.0,It was amazing,aanyasingh-90695,21 July 2023,"I loved to watch the movie, it had all elements one would have want to have seen. The journey of barbie to the real world was something I was really looking forward it and I am quite satisfied with it completely , the movie had lovely humour and I was completely mesmerized by Ryan's character it gave a very balanced effect to the movie, there could be a point where the movie felt very overwhelming due to a lot of factors but it was quite a journey to look forward to, the audience was very pleased around me and everyone had a lot of fun watch it. It seems like a fun movie with a very deep meaning behind, the ending was very unexpected and gave a twist very similar to the truman show.",Barbie
2.0,A Huge Generalization at Best,suziejb-79381,23 July 2023,"What can I say? I went into this expecting at least a few laughs. The trailers didn't even show or come close to reveal the heart of the plot. So here it is: Everything is so horrible and wrong for women today, and most men hate women. Now, as a woman watching this movie, I felt as if I was supposedly being told how much my life as sucked, and how much men have stolen from me. Which is not at all the case. I've had the pleasure of working with men who respect me in a good career, and found the movie distastefully disrespectful of everything I've ever accomplished.I had a few laughs, but found the movie lacking a sense of real purpose and direction. It seemed as though it was seeking to inform everyone about this new agenda that women should be in charge of everything. Wow, sounds like sexism to me. I'd prefer equality, which is something that we currently have.",Barbie
9.0,"Wrapped in Plastic, It's Fantastic",elicopperman,24 July 2023,"After years and years of development and casting changes, the live action Barbie movie is finally out for the whole world to see. Co-written and directed by actor turned filmmaker Greta Gerwig and co-produced by and starring Margot Robbie as the titular doll, the film has proven to be one of the most anticipated summer blockbusters of 2023 and a welcome anniversary present to Warner Bros' 100th year since their inception. Now that the film is out for the public and media to enjoy, the best way to describe it is a hysterically subversive commentary on feminism disguised as a cheesy fantasy comedy.The film follows Stereotypical Barbie and Ken going on a journey of self-discovery following an existential crisis, all the while encountering people who either want to make or break the doll's spirits. Before going into the story itself, the ensemble cast must be addressed, especially Robbie and Ryan Gosling as the primary Barbie and Ken respectively. In addition to sharing witty chemistry with each other, the multiple Barbies and Kens around Barbieland showcase the blessings of multiple roles for women to take on and a curse in how that can influence the men around them to call the shots. Alongside them is America Ferrera as Mattel employee Gloria who has as much to do with Barbie's existential crisis as she does in trying to repair her distant daughter Sasha stuck in her grumpy teen phase, showcasing how different generations operate around the famous Barbie line of toy making. Alongside many other well known names like Will Ferrell and Rhea Perlman as two differentiating role models for women around the world, the ensemble cast is exactly what will draw butts into seats.Now as far as the film itself is concerned, the biggest contributing factor to how outlandish it is is that its worldbuilding makes no sense at all. Barbieland is supposed to be the place where all the Barbies and Kens live their lives to the fullest, yet the real world is interlinked based on how people have played with them. That being said, since the film is meant to highlight the conflicting views of feminism in a still patriarchal society, the imaginative execution of how the dolls and people interact makes for a lot of eye opening politics centered around how complicated the world truly is. While it's difficult to say if the film hit all of its targets, especially when the politics it tackles are still relevant today, its humor and commentary lies in the blending of childhood nostalgia and adult intellectualism. This is what partially leads to Barbie's wanting to leave her ""perfect"" paradise and Ken's attempts to see Barbie for who he pretends to be. Who could have thought a Barbie movie would have reminded us how difficult it is to face having to hide who we truly are out of pressure?Of course, the production and costume design are what truly stand out around this ambitious feature. In contrast to the mundane real world, Barbieland is composed of bright colors and make-believe dream houses, complete with a wide variety of diverse costumes and elaborate sets making up the surreal fantasy landscape. As the Barbies function through pretend toy logic, there are some amusing visual gags based on their imaginary lifestyles and how they appear based on what their owners and Mattel did to them in the long run. The addition of much cartoony stunt work makes the film even more hilarious when you realize how little logic is actually in the film depending on the universe. Next to Mark Ronson and Andrew Wyatt lending their talents to an accompanying score and amusing musical numbers, one can sense a true glance of nostalgia with many well known hit songs that contribute to the film's tone and commercial exploitation. It's hard to say if the film is a jukebox musical or not, but it certainly is a riot with how much the audience will jive to the beat of the tunes.In a day and age where we seem to be forgetting how much fun movies can truly be, Greta Gerwig's Barbie is a wonderful reminder as to why it's ok to embrace your inner child in a world overrun with societal beatdowns and forced maturity. Whether or not you've ever been into the Barbie toy line, this film is an absolute must watch for both the casual filmgoer and fans of hysterical fantasy comedies. It is self aware enough to make us laugh at even the smallest of jokes, it is mature enough to embrace its own immaturity, and it is a reason to still support the hard working crew with how the film industry is going nowadays.",Barbie
10.0,Masterpiece! One of the Best Films I've Seen!!,johnefricker,23 July 2023,"I had high hopes for this film, but it far exceeded my expectations. I highly recommend seeing it in IMAX, because it is visually stunning. On any screen it's still a masterpiece. There were so many stories that could have been told about Oppenheimer, but the way they told the story was so respectful yet captured so many important aspects of his life. With all the controversy, complexity, and mystery that surrounds this story, be it politics, ethics, or science, this film artfully layered it's scenes with a deep understanding, using metaphors and parallels that left me reeling with contemplation. There are so many layers, that this film can be a completely different movie depending upon how much of this story you knew before, yet still leave you dumbfounded by how beautifully these messages are delivered. The cast is nothing short of magnificent. Christopher Nolan is one of my favorites, but this may be his best yet. It's been more than 24 hours, and I'm still mind blown over how good it really was!",Oppenheimer
9.0,A masterpiece.,saifkrieger,21 July 2023,"Nolan is a director who is holding 10 jugs of water which he pours in all different directions, yet all the water seems to pool in one exact spot no matter what. The movie feels like everything going is leading you to a moment, you can feel it coming, you can feel you are being led to it.The movie goes on a fairly low tempo, so consistently low that it made me wonder how Nolan was going to elevate to a climax, but HOLY **** did he do it so swiftly and brilliantly!""Now I am become death. The destroyer of worlds.""And as you reach that moment, it does NOT disappoint. Skin crawls, heart stops for a second, the breath goes out of your lungs, and you can hear a god damn pin drop in the theater.A masterpiece.",Oppenheimer
7.0,Barbie is a pretty fun movie to watch and worth the hype.,paperman-49250,21 July 2023,"As soon as the first teaser trailer dropped on YouTube for Barbie, it captured my attention and admiration for it recreated the ""Dawn of Men"" sequence from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey in a very creative and classic way. The hype of that one minute long clip, featuring (my celebrity crush) Margot Robbie who steals the show no matter what movie or role she is in, had me believing that this movie would be phenomenal. And over the course of several months until today, my expectations for this movie got bigger and bigger. This is partly thanks to the Barbenheimer online phenomenon which I followed and watched the both movies on the same opening day.Honestly, I didn't get everything I expected and I cannot say what I got is better than what I had expected. However, 2 hours of my time in front of that huge screen was pretty fun because Barbie is simply a very fun movie to watch and I absolutely loved it. I believe this is thanks to the feeling of watching it on the big screen with a bunch of strangers around to laugh with. I will definitely watch the movie again upon the digital release to try to prove myself wrong.Margot Robbie is, as always, phenomenal in the movie. Her incredible talent and charm carries almost the entire film, not to mention that she is a co-producer. She is not the best casting choice to play a Barbie doll but in this particular Barbie movie, she was born for the role. Her co-star Ryan Gosling is the comedic heart of the movie. Without him, the movie would certainly not be as fun as it is. The rest of the cast also compliment their roles fairly well, playing iconic characters and dolls of different races and sizes.I was expecting a longer, a more serious and elaborate plot for Barbie but what I got instead is not too bad. The movie clearly carries a message and that message is clearly conveyed through a plot that is brief and basically easy to understand which is built up in a favorable way.The production design and the costume design is certainly a huge part of the film. All the costumes, sets, props and everything look and feel so compelling and, most important of all, accurate to the overall history and legacy of Barbie and Mattel. I hugely respect that attention to detail.At the end of the day, Barbie is a movie I have been impatiently waiting for a long time and that I feel honored to have seen today on the opening day. It is a beautiful work of art paying beautiful homage to the legacy of it's origins and I am happy that I started loving this movie way before its release . . .",Barbie
9.0,An Extremely Clever and Entertaining Experience,kjproulx,26 July 2023,"Well, if a film like The Lego Movie can come out and be clever and great, I guess a Barbie film can as well. I will always hesitate when a product receives a film based on it because it just seems shameful in terms of marketing. Audiences will always receive a few diamonds in the rough though, and Barbie is just that. It's definitely the most fun I've had at the movies this year. It's a lot more than just bright colours so let's get into it.To keep it simple, the film follows Barbie (Margot Robbie) as she realizes there is more to life than just living in Barbieland. Accompanied by Ken (Ryan Gosling), they venture to the real world. With many revelations about how awful our world is, the two of them discover what is both good and bad about life. I'm keeping it vague because what helps this simple story become a more complex one is the social commentary and incredibly funny humour. I was laughing hysterically throughout and I was genuinely moved by the end.Certain viewers may find some of the messages to be heavy-handed, but I didn't. In fact, I found that the messages actually made the film better overall. Yes, it's a film that explores equal rights, but it does so in a fashion that doesn't downgrade anyone, but rather puts others on a higher pedestal. I really liked how the film handled all of the issues it presented. I shouldn't have been too surprised though, because Greta Gerwig as a director is just fabulous.Having liked both Lady Bird and Little Women, Gerwig has continued to impress me as a director, even if I haven't exactly loved any of her films yet. Well, I believe her efforts here made the best film of her career to date. There are so many different variations of Ken and Barbie and the performances she pulls out of each and every one of these performers was nothing short of great. I mean, with that said, it didn't hurt that the cast was perfection.Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are terrific as always and are obviously the main reason to see this film on the surface, but America Ferrera and Simu Liu were also standouts to me. Each character either had a dramatic or comedic moment that stood out and I couldn't get enough of the whole cast. Michael Cera as Allen is gold as well, but in the end, this is a film that all came down to the screenplay. Yes, the set design is award-worthy, the musical number is worthy of an Oscar-nomination, but Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach crafted a genius script here. The nuances throughout are what sent this film over the edge for me. Their attention to detail was perfect here. I highly recommend Barbie to all ages and genders.",Barbie
5.0,Less would have been more,wxqyaxr,23 July 2023,"Overambitieus movie with too many stories to tell that does not manage to tell any of the stories really well because of it. I truly don't understand the high ratings. I was bored to death the last hour with the whole overextended communist drama. Also, the was little character building. Instead the viewer is thrown from scene to scene for the first ninety minutes. The movie doesn't allow you to draw you along further in any scene than surface level which makes many scenes shallow. I felt like sitting through church when I was a little boy. I wanted to leave but I couldn't. I feel mentally raped.",Oppenheimer
2.0,"Never ending inferno of talking heads, spewing informational dialogue",HollandSkies,27 July 2023,"What you get is talking heads saying perfect sentences, in perfect order. Basically it's a Wikipedia article converted to live action people saying it, with some effect shots sprinkled through. That way giving you assumingly lots of historical information, but zero entertainment. I would have enjoyed a voiceover much more.The dialogues are a bit like the classic Star Trek series: Impossibly perfect. But 100% informational, at a much higher pace, and with no time to breath or recapitulate. For 3 hours. It was so bad that it made me giggle at some point, probably out of misery.When I realize how much hard work has been put in by the best people in the industry, my bones start bending and my skin crumble. So much work and what do you get? A never ending inferno of talking heads, spewing informational dialogue:Bla bla bla bla *BABOOOOM!* bla bla bla blaThe BABOOM is the only cinematic moment in this movie.Everything except the BABOOM is smeared with music up to very high annoyance levels in an attempt to spice up the blablabla.

10.0,The best autobiographical film since..?,joibolti,22 July 2023,"What Christopher Nolan achieves with this film is monumental to his catalouge. He proves that he can do more than an insanely complicated plot where you dont know whats left and what right. This film relies on well written dialogue and a dominating performance by Cillian Murphy. Accompanying that is a great display by Robert Downey jr who portrays Lewis Strauss, Downey Jr, shows what he is capable of in Oppenheimer, where Tony Stark is far away.The sound in this film was for me the MVP, my seat buzzed and I got completely engulfed in the film. Without cgi this movie is more beautiful than most we see these days and the feeling afterwards is I need to see it again!I believe this film will be a dominating player at the next Academy Awards and where Nolan might finally be rewarded for his outstanding work.",Oppenheimer
10.0,How Can You Spoil a True Story lol,jadatheriot,26 July 2023,"The reality is that the story captured was not to show people getting blown up or some sort of reenactment of the devastation to Hiroshima and Nagasaki. If that's what you were searching for, first seek professional help. Second, this movie is not for you.If you are looking for a gloss over of powerful and thought provoking historical information and instead a display of 3 hours worth of explosion demonstrations, I encourage YouTube. This movie is not for you.This movie is gripping. The actors so clearly dedicated themselves to portraying a story built on humanity. Humanity is mundane and introspective, as is this movie. If you are searching for some over dramatized and tacky retelling of a prominent historical event, then this movie is just not for you.The reviews on here are interesting but they speak to what Nolan was after in the theme of the movie. Humans are capable of such a lack of humanity and decency unless it's met at their own front door. Ask yourself if what you're searching for in this movie even makes sense before you watch it or judge it.P. S. There can be no spoilers because all of this happened over 50 years ago.

Personally i have a short attention span and i found that the story doesn't captivate you enough to keep you entertained throughout the movie. Either way i would recommend you to watch the movie so that you can understande the ""hype"" behind it.

2.0,I never wanted to leave a running movie before,itspax,22 July 2023,"It was hard to follow and got all the dots together. Movie is mostly dialogues with hard to find the context plus different timelines switched all the time while trying to follow what's going on.I thought the movie was about developing the bomb, moral aspects, other history events and world wide consequences to the weapon. I was terrible wrong. Movie is full of dialogues and telling you what is going on instead of showing it and this for 3 hours straight.Just 40 minutes in I started to get bored and by 1h I was typing on my phone... Also around the middle I was thinking about leaving the cinema for real and this wish was getting bigger every passing minute.In the end of the movie you don't really learn anything or even know what you've just watched.

8.0,"Such an expensive movie, and then you fail to speak proper Dutch for one minute",theeroos,23 July 2023,"In the movie, Oppenheimer is a professor in Leiden, The Netherlands. You can hear him speak 'Dutch' for a class of students, but everyone in our Dutch movie theatre mumbled 'what? What's he saying?' It was a fantasy language, and certainly not Dutch, not even German. I think making a movie about real events requires proper investigation and love for details. Therefore we thought it was irritating that the actor and director didn't check this scene with Dutchies. The movie was very long and there were lots of characters and names you had to remember, but the general warning and impact of human destruction power and balances of power was very clear and very frightening. The uncertainty whether the bomb would destroy the complete atmosphere, and that they took that risk: man, one day we will really destroy earth, one way or the other.",Oppenheimer

8.0,Pure Fun!,kevinfaftine,21 July 2023,"Barbie is a movie about Barbie having an existential crisis! Yeah, that's actually the movie. And it's GREATAll the Barbies in barbieland, believe that they helped woman and young girls be whatever they want to be and empowered them, but Margot Robbie's Barbie finds out that's not true, she completely looses it.Margot Robbie is fantastic and both sides of the spectrum, the stereotypical Barbie and portraying the existential crisis she is one. But at this point what can't Margot Robbie do, she's fantasticRyan Gosling is the real MVP, he puts in a performance of a life time. The ""Ken off""... ""Ken War""?... ""War of Ken's""? Whatever! That whole sequence is amazing, from the song, to the choreography. Ryan Goslings comedic timing is impeccable, and I love the journey he embarks in, and his ending, to finding out he doesn't live for Barbie, he is his own ""Ken""The production design is absolutely fantastic, every single detail is looked after, the costumes are beautiful everything in Barbieland is so colourful and so pretty to look at.There comes a disconnect when they reach the real world, that is a necessary evil. I say that because I didn't like many of the sequences there, but I thought every was necessary for the rest of the movie to work.Not every joke lands, but that's what happens when you take risks, the movie is hilarious nonetheless.It's a fantastic time and my only regret is that I didn't find a pink shirt to wear to the movie.",Barbie

10.0,Oppenheimer: A Cinematic Marvel with Stellar Performances!,amrateek,20 July 2023,"Oppenheimer is an absolute triumph in every sense! This biographical masterpiece artfully depicts the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, and the exceptional performances by Cillian Murphy as Oppenheimer and Robert Downey Jr. As Strauss deserve standing ovations. Murphy's ability to capture Oppenheimer's complex persona, from scientific brilliance to inner struggles, was simply astounding. Equally praiseworthy was Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Strauss, effortlessly bringing depth and charisma to the character.The cinematography in Oppenheimer is awe-inspiring. In particular, the scene showcasing the Trinity bomb's mushroom cloud was a visual marvel. Nolan's skillful use of visuals transported the audience into that historic moment, evoking a mix of emotions ranging from awe to reflection. The movie's attention to historical accuracy and meticulous research added to its authenticity and made it a compelling journey through one of the most pivotal periods in history.From start to finish, Oppenheimer keeps you hooked with its engaging storytelling, impeccable pacing, and thought-provoking dialogue. It delves into the ethical dilemmas faced by Oppenheimer and his team during the creation of the atomic bomb, leaving audiences pondering the consequences of scientific advancements and the weight of responsibility that accompanies such discoveries.The supporting cast delivered commendable performances, enriching the overall narrative. The film's soundtrack seamlessly complemented the visual brilliance, enhancing the emotional impact of every scene.In conclusion, Oppenheimer is a remarkable achievement that deserves widespread recognition. It sheds light on the fascinating life of J. Robert Oppenheimer while raising poignant questions about the implications of scientific progress. Kudos to the entire cast and crew for delivering an extraordinary cinematic experience that will linger in the minds of viewers long after the credits roll.

Go to it expecting a 10 and think your doomed.There is certainly things in this movie to enjoy indeed think it has to many ingredient. The acting of Ken and Barbie are great ironical they get to show off their range by literally barbie/ken.This site really need to lower the minimum review number of words as could have certainly made the same point with half the words, given the option.",Barbie
10.0,A film we need in these times,hanschsolo,22 July 2023,"It feels like the end of the world, without the end of the world. This is not only an huge and twisted story that had and still has global consequences, it's an look inside the mind of the man who gave mankind the power to destroy themselves.Oppenheimer is a genius, and within every scene we are confronted with that. Robert isn't the kind of man which is interested in science, he is the science. He does not think in normal therms, he see's the world in atoms. Especially the first half gives incredibly insight into this. There's a montage which describes his mind and being beautifully.Nolan's hugest strength is his reliability on real facts and real life. His films never are just pure entertainment, and for me that's what makes him stand out, because he gives me a better understanding of a topic I'm merely interested in. I always tend to inform myself about the science behind the ideas of his films, and I love that. Especially in Oppenheimer, when it comes to the scene where the discover nuclear fission, I LOVED it, and I wanted to hear MORE of it.The Los Alamos part is where things get disturbing. That whole build-up to the detonation was heart-pounding, Ludwig Göransson's score builds that tension so high, I was scared for that bang and shockwave. It felt scary and unreal, and when it happened, I had goosebumps all over my body, that look of Oppenheimer without his glasses into the fireball, repeating the Bhagavadgita line, you could feel his infinite regret.That's what makes the film outstanding. The moral conflict of Oppenheimer, you can see it in his eyes for the whole film. Cillian Murphy Is Oppenheimer.It is an extraordinary film of an extreme important topic that every human being which is interested in communism, science, most importantly physics, politics or history should've seen.The world since then never was and will be the same. And my mind simply can't comprehend the thought that there was a slight possibility that they could've caused a chain reaction which would've end the whole world, and they still pushed that button. That thought does not leave my mind.The examination that comes full circle towards the end is outstanding. It's an hyper-realistic representation from the world of politics. Nolan could've dived even deeper into the nature of every character that sits there. Which role they've had, which strategy the followed. Some stand beside Oppenheimer, some against him. Some just needed to protect themselves or were forced or convinced to be against him. Everyone with their own background and own reasoning. Just like in real life. And you can't escape that when you're important. Even when you just want to be a physician. There's only one person who could escape that, Albert Einstein.In the end, Oppenheimer is a film that demonstrates that this event shaped our lives for infinity. We are the most dangerous species that exists, because we gave ourselves the power to destroy ourselves. No mouse ever would've built a mousetrap. It's a testament, that the people leading nations will always strive for more power and might. Scientists always thought about the bad consequences of their experiments but most of the time they forgot the most dangerous thing of all, the human ego and selfishness.",Oppenheimer
5.0,Total waste of talent,greengem,23 July 2023,"One of the best directors and an assemble of Hollywood talent, just to make an emotionless documentary.I can count on one hand the vaguely entertaining moments of this movie.There isn't anything that happens in the first 50 minutes, not even an interesting conversation, including the fictional ones with Einstein.I have an interest in Nuclear Physics and how the war was ended, which mean't I learned absolutely nothing from this movie.There is the side tale of the McCarthy communist witch hunts, but that's all been done before and much better.Cillan Murphy went from Peaky Blinder excellence to play a dead pan scientist. Why?Once the Nolan fan boys have stopped leaving reviews, this movie will drop like a brick, to a more realistic score.It's so poor, I wish I'd watched Barbie. Best thing in Oppenheimer is the poster. End your interest there and you'll be a happier person.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Great!,toriraphael,22 July 2023,"Just amazing and a spectacular film for everyone of all ages. The cast and direction of the film were amazing! The set pieces and art direction was inspired. Additionally, the script was air tight and very funny. I cried and laughed throughout the film. I truly believe the movie will become a classic. The only reason it lost a star was because of some of the loose ends of the plot in the film. Overall the film was a great movie going event and extremely rewarding. I think Gerwig is very good at subverting audience expectations which makes the film more engaging. I would recommend this movie for everyone.",Barbie
9.0,"Now I am become Barbie Girl, the enjoyer of Barbie worlds",cmdown-50506,29 July 2023,"I have been waiting for this to release for so long and I finally got to watch it today. I absolutely loved it! It was fun, it had Margot Robbie (and extra stuff for Tarantino's out there if you know what I mean) And it had some absolute bangers! What more could you want from a new summer classic?Honestly the depth of the story ain't there but what do you expect from a film about a Barbie? Lol I'll probably go back and watch it again tbh and I'll probably purchase it once it releases on blu ray as I did rather enjoy it (seriously my mouth hurts from smiling and laughing) there are some touching moments where Robbie really shines I just wish there were a little more because as everyone I absolutely adore Margot and her films.Anyway Barbie is a blast.

7.0,"Barbie is fun, but gets too focused on the social commentary and does not do the plot justice.",saadhasan-36609,23 July 2023,"Barbie was a very fun, light-hearted, over-the-top movie that takes you on a wild journey. The fact that it paid homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey's opening sequence earned it extra points for me! Ryan Gosling was great and Margot Robbie was perfectly cast, and the production design was fantastic. A comedy movie should mainly be judged on its comedy, and Barbie for the most part is actually quite funny! I also loved how the narrator speaks over the movie at certain points and delivers some funny lines. This may get some backlash, but I feel Barbie is a movie that earns popularity because it propagates feminist ideals and speaks to the issues women face today, and audiences are willing to look past its flaws to celebrate the movie because the message it portrays is very relevant in society today. I feel the same way with Sound of Freedom. Just because a movie talks about issues you care about, however important they may be, doesn't mean it's the ""greatest movie of all time"" and ""Oscar-worthy"" etc. The plot of Barbie seemed quite interesting to me, how Barbie goes into the real world and the chaos that could cause. But I feel like the movie got TOO drenched in the social commentary and thus didn't give the creative plot idea enough justice. Movies don't have to be so explicit with the social commentary, as shown by movies like 12 Angry Men (1957), which IMO does a far better job at tackling racism and prejudice than any film made today. At certain times, Barbie really blurred the line between being anti-patriarchy and being anti-men. It felt like it was fighting injustice with more injustice, although not throughout.",Barbie
1.0,"Um, no Japanese actors in it. Wonder why? Bohring.",joachimokeefe,21 July 2023,"This is a 3-hour long, drama-documentary about the scientist behind the US atomic bomb - emphasis on the drama. Except there is no drama, it's a courtroom flashback to a long succession of meetings, attended by actors on the up doing impressions of famous people from the past. Who were, on the whole, very unpleasant. Chain-smoking, philandering, swotty show-offs, some of them.Because there is no drama, Nolan has to introduce sex scenes; without them, 'Oppenheimer' would be like The West Wing set in 1943. Matt Damon and Cillian Murphy certainly deliver the thespian goods (no chain-smoking for Oppie or daily booze for Grovesy, mind), but there are only two sources of tension:1, Will the Nazis develop The Bomb first?2, Was Oppenheimer a Comyanist?Since everybody knows the answer to both those questions - well, No.1, even if you weren't paying attention - this film is more about 'how well is history dramatised?' Yes, the History Channel will be gnawing its heart out, but even they don't squeeze out 3 hour-shows.This. Movie. Has. No. Story. There are far better movies, and far better books. Nolan tries to cram everything, including quantum theory, in and the result is a long and tedious firework display. By the end, you're wishing you'd never been Born.",Oppenheimer
5.0,"Started good, then turned into a lecture",vrg-76395,23 July 2023,"I really wanted to like the movie, and I totally enjoyed the first third of it, until it turned into a lecture on patriarchy. Women are portrayed as infinitely oppressed people who can't do anything except for crying about their existence.Don't get me wrong, I expected it to be about feminism and empowerment, but not that awfully straightforward about it.I could've been a great movie. A 10/10 movie, but it feels like the authors just hate men so much, they can't think of anything else.I also feel sorry for all female executives at Mattel. The board of directors is portrayed as oppressively male-only, to maintain the narrative.To sum up, you gonna love it if you want to feel sad and oppressed about being a woman. Not so much if you just like Barbies and want to have a good time.",Barbie
6.0,Great acting but why this movie?,moriumemoltre,20 July 2023,"I was really surprised about how much i liked Ryan Gosling in this. I had totally forgot about his comedic talent and timing. The movie works. There is definitely a moral message in this, even though I believe the majority of viewers will be too distracted by Margot Robbie and Ryan Goslings great performances and all of the comedy elements in this and the fact that the script is hardly worth being filmed. I feel like with a different script they could have created something truly great.Over all it's a fun family movie to enjoy together. I watched this and afterwards Oppenheimer last night and I am truly glad I did it in that order, because I doubt that I would have been able to enjoy this even nearly as much if I had watched Oppenheimer first.",Barbie
6.0,Clever and fun beginning turns into another lecture in the patriarchy,Binkconn,21 July 2023,"Barbie begins in an irresistible way, as a fun dismantling of all the plasticized and body image ideals the doll has set for little girls throughout the decades, as Barbie faces an existential crisis and must journey into the real world to find her true self. Then about halfway through America Ferrera shows up as a dissatisfied Barbie designer and starts hammering us about the patriarchy, as if all men were clueless, macho oafs like Ken that needed to be smugly tolerated by the greater hierarchy of women. Gerwig seems to be projecting her issues about Hollywood and it makes Barbie out of touch.",Barbie
7.0,Content per minute is smaller than it seems,thomas-leitha,29 July 2023,"I understand that Nolan knows his craft and his scripts are like you learned it at school. His actors are, as expected, perfect, even in smaller parts. Yet, after three hours, I left the IMAX unsatisfied. No, it was not the ending, that was predictable. I simply don't understand why it took so long to tell a rather simple story. Don't get me wrong, the story is rightfully told, but sometimes I felt all the flashbacks, the continous enjoying soundtrack and repeating similar biographical details are there to simulate greatness. Camerawork is professional but far from being extraordinary and this goes for much of the movie.In the end, despite of the masses flooding the IMAXs, interviews and making of s evoke expectations that are just partially fulfilled.May be everything was too perfect to completely disappoint but falls short to be really great.",Oppenheimer
9.0,A darkly satirical look at gender structure in society,MrDHWong,21 July 2023,"""Barbie"" is a comedy film based on the line of fashion dolls by Mattel. Directed and co-written by Greta Gerwig (""Lady Bird"", ""Little Women"") and starring Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling, it takes every opportunity to revel in its amusing premise with a darkly satirical look at gender structure in society.In Barbieland, a matriarchal utopia where all women are successful, Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) lives a happy life spending time with her female friends and hanging out with her boyfriend Stereotypical Ken (Ryan Gosling). One night at a dance party, Stereotypical Barbie suddenly finds herself contemplating her own mortality and worries about what her future holds. The next day, Stereotypical Barbie discovers she is now unable to follow her usual routine, which results in her perfect skin breaking out in blemishes. After following advice from Weird Barbie (Kate McKinnon), Stereotypical Barbie travels in her convertible to the real world to meet the child who plays with her, unaware that Stereotypical Ken has stowed away onboard.If you had to name a more iconic doll associated with little girls, I'm sure nearly everyone's first pick would be none other than Mattel's Barbie. Since first being launched back in 1959, Barbie has taken the world by storm, with the doll filling many different roles, including but not limited to a doctor, lawyer, astronaut, and even President of the United States. There have also been many movies made that star Barbie in leading roles, all of which have been CGI animated and released exclusively to video and streaming sites. Now adding to that catalogue, Greta Gerwig's live action cinematic feature titled simply ""Barbie"" is not only a fantastic send-up of gender roles but also a great comedy film in its own right that virtually everyone can enjoy regardless of age, gender, or political leaning.What could have been another generic film for parents to put on in the background to keep their young daughters quiet is actually one of the cleverest deconstructions of the world's view of the societal hierarchy since 2014's ""The LEGO Movie"". When we first see Barbieland, it is shown to be a bustling, exuberant paradise that is perfect for all of its inhabitants. That is, of course, only if you are a woman, and not one of the ""Kens"" where their enjoyment is based solely on being an accessory to the other ""Barbies"". It is obvious that this is a place where men cannot make a name for themselves, which sets in motion Stereotypical Ken's desire to travel with Stereotypical Barbie into the real world. Upon arriving, Ken learns that this new place is the mirror opposite of Barbieland, with real life society valuing patriarchy over matriarchy. In any normal instance, I would have rolled my eyes watching a movie allude to contentious political matters like this, but I quickly realised that the film is actually attacking both sides of the spectrum in the best way possible. In Barbieland, the matriarchy causes the women to exude toxic femininity towards men while in the real world we see the patriarchy make men show off their toxic masculinity towards women. Neither of these are glorified and where this film succeeds greatly is in the way it cleverly informs the audience that the extremes on both ends are what causes problems with society and that too much of either always leads to bad results.In addition to satirising gender norms, the film also functions as an amusing, gag-packed standalone comedy for casual viewers as well. There were a number of moments where I found myself laughing out loud at some of the jokes being made about the autonomous way Barbieland's populace live their lives. For instance, the Barbies are incapable of touching the ground with flat feet due to their default designs being made for high heel shoes. Also, the Kens are almost always seen at the beach awaiting instructions from the other Barbies, only for most of them to be ignored. However, some of the film's most hilarious parts occur when Barbie and Ken are in the real world, allowing for some humorous fish-out-of-water scenes involving their interactions with real people. There's even the occasional jab taken at Mattel themselves, parodying the commercialism surrounding Barbie and all her accessories. While not every single joke lands, there are so many of them that for every one that fails there are plenty of others that work just fine. In fact, without giving it away, this film has one of the funniest closing lines to a movie I've ever heard, so much so that it actually caught me off guard during my initial viewing.I also liked the practical production design of this movie, with minimal CG giving Barbieland a real toy-like aesthetic. As one might expect, the most prominently used colour here is pink. Nearly everything important in this world is pink - pink houses, pink beds, pink lamp posts, etc. Believe it or not, there was actually a worldwide shortage of pink paint due to the amount that was used to make this place look as authentically girly as possible. Later when Barbie and Ken are exploring the outside world, things look decidedly ordinary but since they are still wearing their brightly-coloured outfits, the two to stick out like a sore thumb from everybody else. It's rare for a film to effectively use its colour palette to evoke comedy so effectively and this one handles it in a way that all ages will understand it.As a Barbie girl living in her Barbie world, Margot Robbie is clearly having a great time portraying this stereotypical version of the iconic doll. The fact that there's nothing especially noteworthy about this specific Barbie means that she has the most room to grow as a character. Robbie's Barbie is friendly, fun-loving, but blissfully ignorant of what her boyfriend Ken truly wants with her. Though not outright malicious, she inadvertently makes Ken feel unwanted due to her conditioned attitude towards all the other Kens in her world. What I liked best about Robbie's performance was the way she shows an open-mindedness to the character. She is curious about what type of world lies beyond Barbieland and whether things will be the same or different to what she is used to. It would have been easy to have made this Barbie a man-hating blonde bimbo with no capacity for independent thought but rather she remains pleasant towards everyone and is willing to learn about new experiences on her journey.Whether intentional or not, I think Ryan Gosling's version of Ken steals the movie practically every time he is shown on screen. Maybe it's because I'm so used to seeing Gosling play stoic, subdued roles but watching him come to life as this version of Barbie's boyfriend was quite a surprise. Although this isn't the first comedic role Gosling has played, it is here that he effectively demonstrates all the humorous possibilities he is capable of as an actor. We watch Ken try to surf at the beach as a means to impress Barbie, only to realise he cannot ""swim"" in the placemat water. Later, he tries to apply for certain jobs in the real world based solely on his gender, but is told that he needs proper qualifications in order to be taken seriously by employers. There's just something about the way Gosling is able to showcase such loveable pathos as Ken that makes you want to see how he can become more than just the generic partner of his more famous girlfriend.From the perspective of a 30-something heterosexual man who has never once expressed interest in playing with dolls, the film ""Barbie"" pulls off the miraculous task of transcending above its stereotypical audience of young girls to appeal to all viewers instead. It offers an observant satire about the world's views on gender roles while also functioning as an amusing comedy film packed with jokes galore. No matter what your general opinion on Barbie may be, whether you love her as an entertaining toy or hate her because you don't care for what she represents, this movie has you covered on both fronts. In that regard, this film has done its job.I rate it a solid 9/10.",Barbie
9.0,A fantastic satirical drama of patriarchy,Filmfellas,26 July 2023,"A fantastic satirical drama on patriarchy blended with witty humor, fabulous direction, and fabulous acting.It can be many things, but not a kids' film or gender-specific film.Greta takes us into fantasy barbieland with the deep concepts of consumerism, patriarcy, physical insecurity, and self-discovery cleverly layered under it.Conveys all these in a satirical and humorous way subtly and beautifully.I loved how it shows both extremes of patriarchy of men and also women.The sets, visuals, music, and costumes were just so amazing sets the whole vibe.Ken and Barbie had such awesome chemistry and genreated great humor on the screen.I was so excited to see margot robbie & emma mackey together in the film. And they were fantastic. All the others were beautiful, both in looks and acting.There are some really good one-liner and monologues which are funny & make you think at the same time.I felt good hearing about the response for Barbie, considering the talk around baribie being a silly film for only kids or gender s0ecific. But it's much more than that.So, indians, after watching the hyped up oppenheimer, watch Barbie too, and you won't be disappointed.",Barbie
9.0,Fun and heartwarming,qgyrhyt,21 July 2023,"When I first walked into the cinema to watch this movie my first expectation is just for it to be funny and fun pink bling bling stuff but I should've expected a more deeper meaning to this movie when it's a Greta Gerwig movie.And what even more interesting about this movie is when you watch this at the first half you would think it is solely about woman empowerment and stuff but at the end it really does explain about man's feeling and insecurities as well. The introduction of patriarchy towards Ken is such an amazing and fun scene to watch. Ryan gosling is such a good actor to play the himbo role since you can enjoy his character despite how he portrayed the toxic masculinity role so well.But I wanna focus more on my point of view as a woman myself here. Watching this movie as someone who's childhood revolves around Barbie doll brings so much nostalgia and make me realize how it plays a huge part in my journey as a woman. The transitions from being a little girl to a woman is spot on. It touches about insecurities and the man's expectations of a woman and many more crucial problems.It is so woman empowering and the message is quite obvious and delivered pretty strongly and straight forward in the scripts. But I couldn't deny the scriptwriting really touches my heart and makes me wanna cry. But i still wish it was being potrayed and conveyed more subtly as it will be more fun for viewers to interpret the message itself but I understand that this Barbie movie's targeted audience could be from all range of age so the message should be crystal clear.It's just some people might think that this movie is solely forcing an agenda. Like as a woman I get this whole messages but for someone else it might be coming off to strong and seems pretty stereotypical feminism BS which is a hard pill to swallow but we all know certain people in our society will have that kind of opinion when they saw the movie. That's why I wish it comes more naturally, thats all. But I think the ending make up the whole strong message about feminism earlier with how its was not just about that.Like I said the movie also touches about the whole experience as a human no matter what their gender are and how we're flawed but that's just what life is.",Barbie
4.0,It's good for an evening with popcorn in front of the TV,petrxpp,23 July 2023,"Going to the cinema is a waste of money if you just not want only watch Margot. Barbie certainly had the potential for an original and fresh adventure musical, but alas. Unfortunately, even well-chosen actors, well-written songs or an original and fresh visual cannot save a completely tragic scenario.A mess of banal clichés and a completely wasted opportunity. With such a budget, a cast and an interesting iconic toy, it should have been handled better.The film has a very interesting and brisk first half, but from the second it drags on at a disgusting pace.Even worse is the completely inappropriate, overblown and absurd push towards feminism.",Barbie
9.0,A Invigorating Exploration into the Human Condition,nicolewarriner,23 July 2023,"After watching the trailers, promotional materials and interviews I had very high hopes for this film, especially when looking at Greta's other work. I was not disappointed.I went to see it at the cinema with my partner the first weekend of its release, and before I had even sat in my seat I was already impressed. Over half the audience were families with young children, dressed up and holding their own barbie dolls. The rest were couples, older people, groups of young lads, and friends. The majority of the audience were sporting pink, and there was a real buzz of excited chatter in the air that I can not recall ever experiencing to this extent before a film. I think this is a testament to the entire creative team, to manage to produce so much excitement among so many different types of people is a feat I have not personally witnessed accomplished in my entire adult life.The opening scenes were outstanding. The introduction to barbie struck me on an emotional level, and perfectly set up the characters of the film. The introduction to Barbie left me reminiscing of my own childhood experiences of playing with the dolls, and managed to perfectly capture the excitement that was to come.I really enjoyed how some things were left unsaid, and your imagination had to do the groundwork. In a film made to appeal to both children and adults, often most aspects are over explained and nothing is left up to interpretation, yet Barbie managed to ask questions it did not provide complete answers for, whilst still maintaining accessibility for its entire audience.It had some really imaginative sequences and routines that ensured the film had constant sparkle. The choreography and set design complimented these aspects beautifully.There were really touching moments on humanity, feminism, society and relationships, without villainizing Ken (Men), which would have been an easy cop out.It was also oozing with comedic value, Robbie and Reynolds were hilarious, and brought a youthful exuberance to their respective roles. None of the jokes fell flat, and there were many moments where I was laughing out loud in the cinema.I will say that the casting of the mother and daughter did not feel as strong, and that there were some scenes of product placement that felt really forced and did briefly take me out the film.Additionally, I felt the film did not really know how to finish its story, and the last 30 minuets were weak compared to the rest of the movie.Despite these criticisms, I absolutely adored the film. A more honest reflection would probably lead me to score it 8/10, however, personally, the relationship I had with Barbies in my own childhood strengthened my appreciation for the film.It was funny, touching, exciting all whilst being really quite sad. I laughed and I cried.I would recommend this film to anyone, as I feel that all people going to see it with an open mind will find that they authentically enjoy it.Thank you Greta, for taking me back to my own childhood, and capturing those big questions that begin in our youth on the big screen.",Barbie
10.0,Surpassed My Expectations,rdfcase,23 July 2023,"I did not know what to expect from the Barbie movie when I went with my two adult daughters. I was very pleasantly surprised! The movie made me laugh and it sometimes brought a tear to my eye (but I mostly laughed through it). The sets are spectacular. I would not be surprised if the movie wins an Academy Award for at least the set design. Ryan Gosling is very funny as the underrated Ken and Margot Robbie is very well suited to play the iconic doll. A very good commentary on how, sometimes, the Real World works. The story was, at times, very touching, but it's mostly a really good time. I loved it!!",Barbie
10.0,Christopher Nolan is another masterpiece,hmzayilmaz,23 July 2023,"I had great expectations when I went to the movie. When I left the movie, all my expectations were met. We can say that it is nolan's best movie.Murpy once again performed a great acting and the film, albeit silently, explained the flood that broke inside Oppenheimer very well. The fact that the cast is perfect, it is in different dates, and most importantly, when it is colored, the black and white screen from the eyes of Oppenheimer and the third person view, it is also wonderfully processed.Let's come to the bad side, the person who wants to watch this movie can definitely watch it in a cinema with Imax, I think there will be no same effect in a place without Imax.",Oppenheimer
1.0,Felt like a hallmark movie,mowrylaura,25 July 2023,"This movie should have been for free and on the hallmark channel. So sappy, and preachy. It felt like it was trying too hard to get the message across when it could have been orchestrated better. Also all this hype and getting people to wear pink and excited for Barbie movie when the movie itself was completely opposite of the original Barbie. Like we get it, women have insecurities blah blah blah. We all know this. You didn't make us realize this in the movie. Idk in my opinion not worth spending your money to go watch this movie, just wait for it to go on Netflix and watch it at home!!!!!!!!",Barbie
8.0,it is great,gehete-40949,22 July 2023,"I was going to give this movie a 7, but in good conscience I couldn't. Christopher Nolan has spoiled us with so many good movies, that the expectations I had were way too high, the quality of the movie were overshadowed by them.By quality I mean of course, the music, the cuts, the shots of brilliant representations of physical phenomena that oozed raw creativity. The acting by top class actors/actresses, the very sweet and sour romance scenes, that appeared to be side stories but had still emotional impact. The build up to the test scene of the bomb, that felt forever due to the tension and anticipation created, just by showing little essential details of the realistic bomb assembly and detonation aspect.All very Nolan, all amazing. As every one of his movies, it just feels clean, never rough on the edges, always deliberate, always transparent regarding his intentions of every scene.Now I was going to give this movie a 7, primarily because of how dialogue driven it is. A lot of reviewers praised the script but personally I was disappointed by the story. It leaned too heavily on the political, it is fair to say that half of this movie is a look at red scare propaganda and its consequences. A movie about the bomb, one of the most technical weapons in human history, a collaborative effort of the greatest scientific minds and you chose to focus on politics ? Granted WW 2 espionage also makes for great movies but if you are to put Oppenheimer as the star, you cannot rely on politics. That was my opinion as I watched 2-hour long footage of people just talking about russians, communism, spies, backstabbers, meanwhile a bomb was being built in the background.The most interesting aspect, the science, the war, the moral and very real physical devastation, the strain it must take on one persons mind were addressed but never emphasized.The first bomb test, as a side note, was not that great. You could definitely tell that it was dynamite.Still a great watch, not Nolan's greatest though.",Oppenheimer
8.0,A shrewd satire?,catooooo,25 July 2023,"Is Barbie a shrewd satire? Despite the existence of two divided factions, in this case, men versus women, which is somewhat comical given that the dispute revolves around whether Barbie's message is ""correct"" or not, the film can be appreciated by both female and male audiences. The work addresses highly delicate themes that are complicated to consider in today's society, as they inevitably generate controversy.Nevertheless, the film achieves this with a genuinely humorous approach, inserting clever jokes in moments where the plot becomes dense, interrupting the atmosphere and eliciting laughter from a significant portion of the audience. Personally, while experiencing this situation, I was one of the few gentlemen who attended the screening individually, surrounded by women, and I delighted in the subtly acidic references and humor about current affairs.I greatly enjoyed how the film incorporates references to other cinematic classics, such as ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""The Godfather,"" two films that are historically revered as some of the best of all time. Moreover, the work addresses contemporary controversies, such as patriarchy, feminism, and the stereotypes imposed on bodies deemed ""perfect.""I won't delve into the details of the plot, as it unfolds linearly, as expected in this film. Its development is solid and fitting, focused on a main objective of exposing the marked contrast between our sociocultural reality and a fictional dimension imbued with idealized visions. I must express my surprise at this creation since it was expected that it would merely promote a new collection of Barbie dolls or evoke superficial nostalgia, yet it turned out to be precisely the opposite.One aspect that I would like to emphasize is the careful selection of actors, where Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling embody the stereotype of beauty, both female and male, that society deems ""perfect."" Both actors, in their respective roles, present themselves as vulnerable to various challenges inherent to their genders. The film conveys a message that despite possessing a body considered ""perfect"" or conforming to the Barbie stereotypes, it does not negate the possibility of experiencing distress, sadness, fatigue from wearing heels, or confronting the presence of cellulite, ultimately preventing us from being everything we aspire to be. This message intertwines with the reality of women in modern times, addressing the complexities and challenges they face in their daily lives.The film fulfills its objective by serving as a critique of society, admittedly leaning towards an unfavorable perspective on the male gender while taking for granted the superiority of the female gender. As a man, I personally was not offended by the jokes directed at the male gender in the film; on the contrary, I appreciated how the film vividly portrays the simplicity, happiness, and lack of complications that we, as men, can achieve.Without further ado, adorned with a rosy hue and brief musical moments that do not overwhelm, adding to Barbie's experience, even though it is targeted at a specific audience, it proves to be exceptionally enjoyable. Therefore, I wholeheartedly recommend it. After all, who wouldn't want to laugh at themselves while acknowledging our human nature, filled with imperfections?",Barbie
7.0,"Super fun, super colorful, and very plastic!",scubadoo-35256,26 July 2023,"The entire cast does such a great job and it seems everyone had a fun time making the film. Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling are of course stand outs, but Michael Cera as Allan and Issa Rae as Barbie were also phenomenol! The sets were gorgeous, according to behind the scenes, everything was practical when it could be, and that made such an obvious difference in bringing the Barbie world to life. The costumes!!! So much fun, so much pink, and Robbie's long-standing relation with chanel wormed it's way into costuming as well, truly there are a bunch of unique and extremely well done pieces!However, this is still a movie made to appeal to the widest audience to make the most money possible. There's some popular feminism, but nothing that challenges status quo, and nothing too disagreeable for the average audience. It's pretty to look at, but lacks adequate substance in favor of just bringing up the talking point to say they acknowledged it. Furthermore the movie is extremely uninterested in exploring anything about Mattel's business practices or perpetual consumerism. Not that I was expecting it to, but both those potential issues are very blatantly sidelined and made for humor which sometimes feels like a bit much for me.Anyways, if you want a pretty looking and pretty funny movie that'll definitely continue to make a stupid amount of money, it is well worth it!",Barbie
10.0,Abosolutely the best,jasminegmrk,22 July 2023,"Come on Barbie, let's go smash the patriarchy!Greta Gerwig is the freaking best!! Looking at all the one/two stars reviews written by obviously male audience (or males who haven't watched it, just wanna express their fragile and insecure masculinity) makes this film even more ironic and a mirror of our society. Brava, Gerwig!Must take your boyfriends, straight male friends, brothers to watch this film, a good way to educate them or you know, get the hell out of the relationship while you still can.It's not just a simple film anymore, it's a sensational experience, a work of new generation. Maybe it's not perfect, but we need this, the society need this, the straight white male dominated Hollywood absolutely need this.",Barbie
7.0,"A ""Barbie"" girl on the loose from her ""Barbie"" world, a fun mixed film of fantasy and reality.",blanbrn,21 July 2023,"Being a boy growing up I was never a ""Barbie"" doll collector, always had mostly ""Star Wars"", ""WWF"", and ""He Man"" figures, yet I like all others knew the impact and cultural historical vibe of the Mattel toy line. This film from director Greta Gerwig which blends the toy and real worlds together, so well showing what it's like to deal with being accepted into reality with people who have loved you as a toy doll. The movie rightfully called ""Barbie"" is a fun one a real sentimental journey a film really of escape, fantasy, a touching adventure that's blended with comedy and drama. The acting and on screen chemistry is in top notch form with ""Barbie""(the beautiful and sexy attractive Margot Robbie) and ""Ken""(Ryan Gosling) as they live in the colorful and magical playland life it all seems just a dream, only when signs of malfunction and a hint that ""Barbie"" might be human the film changes. As going into the real world to search for the cure to become a toy again offers plenty of moments that have you as a viewer laughing and feeling emotions as you really along, with the central character feel the compare and contrast and weigh the choices and decisions that humans must make, and the real world even sees the ""Barbie"" toys in a different light. Overall well done good feel good entertaining film as the sets and displays of pink give escape and fun, even if you were not a ""Barbie"" collector you will enjoy this film as it provides the messages of love and acceptance.",Barbie
6.0,Well grate movie but disappointed for some reason,sohamvhadgir,25 July 2023,So I have watched this movie the opening is so great they started movie with awesome sound effects i really great ful to watch such movie but they really disappointed me on the Gita scene 😢 Even this book is one of the pure book in world I don't like this scene they derespect the book.

10.0,Masterpiece!,mo-34254,21 July 2023,"Another masterpiece from the master himself, Christopher Nolan.Fascinating movie, cast, and production.With its everyone-and-the-kitchen-sink casting, alternating between color and black and white, fit-for-Imax spectacle and Ludwig Göransson's pounding musical score, Oppenheimer seeks to overwhelm the audience, an approach that works to an extent.The gorgeous visuals by DP Hoyte van Hoytema, the impeccable sound design by Richard King and the impressive editing by Jennifer Lame come together to create something stirringly grandiose yet delicately intimate.Definitely the movie of the year.",Oppenheimer
3.0,Avoid like the plague,vincentsheehan,25 July 2023,"A confused, misfiring, tedious and pretentious affair. I was expecting much better, yet ultimately disappointed. Margot Robbie (and to a lesser extent, Ryan Gosling) is very good, but otherwise even she can't save this twaddle. Don't listen to the critics - it is crap!Pros: the opening scene apeing '2001 a Space Odyssey' was funny.Cons: It needed better editing to create a more coherent structure It had very dull patches (despite the pink) The emphasis on the 'patriarchy' was definitely laid on too thick Will Ferrell was not funny in this. He needs to really understand that whatever comes out of his mouth is not necessarily instant comedy gold.Avoid!!!!!",Barbie

Seriously, and I love it for that!",subxerogravity,23 July 2023,"I mean, Margo Robbie as Barbie just made perfect sense, but I really wanted to see the movie when I herd that Ryian Gosling was going to be Ken, I just thought that would be hilarious and I was right!I was a little bit nervous when I heard this was not going to be an in-universe thing and that Barbie would enter the real world, but that was a great story.The real-life story did give the art direction the purpose of making a ""BarbieLand"" with life size dream houses even I wanted to live in. The film just looks really good.Give praise to director Greta Gerwig because this movie is fun but there were a lot of deep life cuts and the balance between the two was perfect.It was good hands down.",Barbie
6.0,The mainstream doll with not such a mainstream film,TomTalksFilms,28 July 2023,"I finally plucked up the courage and wore my usual all black clothes as I braved the hordes of pink wearing women to watch Barbie the latest release from director Great Gerwig. The film opens with a voice over from Helen Mirren telling us how Barbie changed the doll business, no longer did young girls just have dolls that were encouraging them to stay in the kitchen now they had barbie who could have any career with the change of an outfit. Straight away this should tell you about the gender politics of this film but more on that later. We then cut to Barbieland where everything is plastic and fantastic that is until one day Barbie out loud says do you ever think about death? (Is there not a therapist barbie?). From there starts an adventure where Barbie and Ken travel to the real world, barbie in search of her owner to find the source of her new found depressive thoughts and Ken well in search of Barbies heart.This film is a hard one to unpick as it's just chaos, there's so much going on all the time, so much so that the slower moments act as nice breathers for the audience. There's dance sequences, action sequences, jokes, gender politics and somewhere in here there's the typical Barbie plot that you might presume this film would have but it's covered with loads of other stuff. The thing I'm most torn on with this film is that I want to praise Gerwig for creating a Barbie film that no one would have predicted while at the same time I can't help wondering if I personally would have enjoyed it more had it been more generic. I'm always talking about how films should be more creative and yet this is the question this film has me asking myself. It's just different and it definitely isn't a kids film, a young girl sat a couple of rows behind me had to keep asking her mum what was going on and I don't blame her as if I was 6,7,8 years old I wouldn't have had a clue. This film seems to be aimed at women Greta's age which is a surprise to me as I thought she was in her late twenties for some reason but you can Google her actual age if you wish to know. Now I know her actual age some of the more older niche references to bands and films etc make more sense and I think it's women that are a similar age to her that she's trying to appeal to here.That brings me onto the films central theming which is its gender politics. It's a film that's about women and for women and in that it does a great job, I think for its target audience it could be an impactful and empowering piece of art. That being said however if you're a pre teen girl or a man you might not get the full emotional impact of this film and I feel that's a bit of a missed opportunity. If this film had eased up on the gender politics at times I think it could have appealed to a wider audience and in doing so may have been able to spread the films message further but I think it's largely ended up falling on death ears to those who aren't in its target audience. It's a shame because the film has an important message to share about equality but it's one that men need to get onboard with as much as women to bring about any real change.By the way, for a film that's supposed to be telling women to be who they are and challenge the patriarchy why has a trend been created for women to wear pink to this film considering it's one of the most commonly associated colours with women?Overall I'm not the target audience for this film but I had a good time nonetheless, it's not one I'll be hurrying back too with haste though.",Barbie
9.0,Amazing film,aleman-23298,26 July 2023,"If you're looking for major explosions and an action packed film, this is NOT it. This is practical effects, amazing dialogue and good view on Oppenheimer and his life and the history of the atom bomb and the moral quagmire on the impact on humanity because of it. Thought provoking and the realization that you can be the smartest man In the room but you have people who want to discredit that. Only reason for not giving it at 10/10 is because the run time. You can feel it towards the end. The run time is worth it however to make sure that you get the entirety of Oppenheimer's life from the start and post WW2.",Oppenheimer
1.0,Full of boring film,pandeyasish,22 July 2023,"I watched this film. I went to see this film considering it as a film made on science fiction and scientific community, but in this 3-hour film, the story went on for only 15 to 20 minutes, after that there was a heated debate about American communist politics in closed rooms.I had read that Oppenheimer had an affinity for Bhagwat Gita but added that too to his sex scene.Those who are in the mood to watch it as a film based on the research of atomic bomb, they will find it very boring, but those who are interested in American communist politics, they might like something.But acting of Cillian Muphy was excellent.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Absolute perfection in cinematography,miachamoun,26 July 2023,"Words can't explain how beautifully crafted this film is. Christopher Nolan just continues to produce mastermind film making. Perfect music score. There was not one moment within the film that I was not truly intrigued. The non linear timeline of the story further builds suspense, which is much needed in a 3 hour film. The acting was absolutely phenomenal and reveals the tension in each scene. The attention to detail with the historical details and physics terminology is further impressive such as the sound from the trinity test occurring a bit after the bomb was detonated. Truly astonished by Nolan's cinematic choices with each film he creates.",Oppenheimer

In the film everything was on the highest level, the cast, cinema, musical accompaniment, plot, sound, in one word everything! Throughout the film, he keeps the viewer in some tension, as if you are experiencing all the emotions that Oppenheimer himself experienced.Watching these movies makes you realize how much the human brain can do.

The way that the Barbie world was created leads the viewer to be sucked into the world of Barbie.

3.0,Started good,michela-54051,24 July 2023,"The movie started on the light side and fun, but the longer it went on the more preachy it became. It seemed the movie could not make up its mind if it was going to be a light and a fun movie or a heavy teaching a life lesson movie. This gives the viewer a roller coaster type viewing, where you are laughing a little (not a lot), but then the movie goes into a long, life lesson on how men are bad, and not very smart, but somehow they run the real world. Women are the real smart ones and the real world needs to change to match Barbie world. This changes the whole movie from just a fun time to head beating lesson, which takes a lot of the fun out of it. Too bad.",Barbie
1.0,Floppenheimer (Maybe not),krazysoon,21 July 2023,"3 hours I can't get back. I fed into the hype. The countless news articles and YouTube videos about the movie. And then I watched it...Boy was I disappointed. I should've known better. Oppenheimer is a very boring and tedious film. It requires your FULL attention and I'm not a fan of that. The scenes were way too long and the pacing was slow as a snail. What did I expect? An action film or a thriller? It's a biography about the brilliant mind(s) behind one of the most pivotal moments in world history. Having said that, it doesn't make the movie likable in my opinion. On a positive note the acting and cinematography was great. Everything else was meh.",Oppenheimer
7.0,South Park episode on an acid trip,PaperCoffins,22 July 2023,"I really don't know what to say about this movie . Everything was colorful, the humor was there , the satire and everybody did great at what they were suppose to do . I went in there with low expectations because it's a Barbie film but I was surprised how adult the humor was and the message it got across was pretty touching . Margot Robbie as Barbie was perfect casting and the theatre was filled , everybody had a good time . I should give this score maybe a bit higher but I just felt it was just a bunch of things mashed together I was watching a parody episode of South Park which is not a bad thing , I though it was the right direction for a movie called Barbie . It was weird to me but in a very good way and LOL at the ending , made everybody laugh . Check it out , I say it's worth a view in the theatre.",Barbie
10.0,Great comedy with a positive message,Leemis,24 July 2023,"Didn't know what to expect... was pleasantly surprised. Clean humor that honored the struggles of women internally as well as those who feel displaced culturally in the US. Liked that it spoke the the variety of people and our roles in society. Was a reminder those thatsuffer struggle, sticking together, through intelligence, compassion and communication can make the world a better place and can be an amazing support structure. It encouraged acceptance of people with differences, people that don't look like you and challenged the battles over ""what's feminine"" or ""what's masculine"" (after all Barbie and Ken have no genitals).",Barbie
5.0,Only thing that saved this was good acting and sound track,jjankel123,22 July 2023,"Honestly, not too sure what my partner and I were expecting, but we figured it would be a fun, empowering, and sweet movie.Instead, we got a preachy, confused, mess that oscillated between comedy and social commentary in a wildly jarring way.Unfortunately, I think the writers took the opportunity to project their feelings onto the audience. The message seems dated and naive. At best it's a bit of an eye roll, at worst it's an attempt to shame young girls into a self defeating thought process.Acting, sound track, set design, and some bits of comedy were really good, and there is some genuine cinema in there.",Barbie

10.0,So glad I went!,jacanny,26 July 2023,"When I heard that a ""Barbie"" movie was coming out, I had absolutely no intention of seeing it, never mind watching it in an actual movie theatre. I had every Barbie doll as a young girl in the 60's, even Allen. Barbie was definitely NOT my role model, and I am thankful for the live women who were. My daughter went to see it with friends last week and convinced me to see it, because it wasn't what I would expect. I am so glad that I did not wear mascara! I was in tears laughing yet totally moved by the message. A movie that is both inspiring and funny is truly rare. The cast and the message were perfect. Talk about ""Girl Power""!",Barbie

First girls movie I love with no overt emphasis on a romantic relationship. Just a beautiful, complex, funny story about barbie. Everyone was perfectly casted.

This movie is the greatest cinematic experience I've ever had. Nolan presented a historical and innovative masterpiece in terms of storytelling and ambiguity in a well-known true story. He presented the dialogues in an interesting and enthusiastic manner. The soundtrack was used in the film with the events in a great way. The sound effects are the best ever. As well as visual.

6.0,I may need to watch it again,logan-86265,20 July 2023,"This movie being shot in 70mm IMAX film doesn't make any sense once I watched it, the movie itself isn't very cinematic. Additionally the film throws around so many names and characters it makes it very hard to follow dialogue and story. I walked out being confused and a little underwhelmed. Near the end, the movie will lose most of the audience with all of the concepts, characters and lawsuits style scenes the last for a third of the movie. Personally the movie got worse and worse, with looser plot and story as it went. The one thing I well give Nolan is the sound design and ost, so goddamn good, it's my favorite part.

8.0,Not better than Oppenheimer but a fun movie,Isak777,26 July 2023,"I saw it in a theater the day after I saw Oppenheimer and it was a fun movie.I honestly think Margot Robbie is perfect as barbie in this movie. Ryan Gosling as Ken is also good. I think that because of the movies PG-13 rating the movie doesn't target audience aren't kids and there were some violence scenes and Barbie really mentions a lot of death and she has thoughts of dying.The movie opened $155M and I think it's going to reach $1B at the worldwide box office.The things I really liked some of the soundtrack. The soundtrack features Billie Eilish, Ice Spice and Nicki Minaj, Dua Lipa, and so much more singers. I also really loved the song Just Ken by Ryan Gosling. I also loved the idea of making this movie and the director Greta Gerwig is just a great film director from movies such as Lady Bird and Little Women.Some scenes were very boring but I guess it's ok.I just think that you can't compare this movie to Oppenheimer because Oppenheimer is way better.It's a good movie.It's still a good movie and my expect.",Barbie
6.0,"""Property is Theft""... Are you kidding me?",schlomo-jones,21 July 2023,"I was excited to see this film, but ended up feeling really disappointed. The overall structure is a convoluted mess. Nolan jumps around in the timeline with his narrative style, which was suited for Interstellar or Inception, but just makes a mess of story in a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb.Firstly, Is it worth seeing? Yes, but there's no reason to rush to the theater and watch in on the big screen. It's mostly a dialogue-driven film, and the big ""boom"" scene isn't impressive. It looks like they just blew up a big stack of dynamite and filmed it. Obviously they couldn't blow up a real nuke just to make a movie, and maybe CGI didn't look good. Either way, the bomb test scene, when it finally gets there, despite seeing it in IMAX, with booming speakers, was underwhelming.Much of the film focuses on the personality of J. Robert Oppenheimer as a flawed person, neither martyr nor warmonger. Cillian Murphy's portrayal is fantastic. However, the plot focuses heavily on the McCarthy-era interrogation he faced where he lost his security clearance, and was subsequently removed from the Atomic Energy Commission. Of course we also see the development of the atomic bomb, and various snippets of Oppenheimer the ""fellow traveler"" (those who were sympathetic to communist and left wing causes but never joined the party), Oppenheimer the womanizer who cheats on his wife, Oppenheimer the clumsy student who isn't as smart as his peers, and finally Oppenheimer the charismatic leader and of some of the most brilliant minds in the world working on the atomic bomb.The follow up to this is all having to do with a more obscure figure in history, named Lewis Strauss, potrayed by Robert Downey, jr. This is where the plot gets lost. Without knowing all the details of Strauss's involvement ahead of time, the whole witch-hunt trial was confusing and convoluted. This part of the story dragged on forever.Now, regarding the historical accuracy, there are lot of famous figures represented in this movie. It's true that Oppenheimer knew all these people, and all these world-famous physicists who, during this strange time in history, were as world reknown as rock stars and entrepreneurs are today. However, they barely say much, they just appear to have a few words while they point Oppenheimer to different people.I also found it odd that Nolan decided to include Einstein, but no mention of how he too was considered a fellow traveler and had more communist affiliations than Oppenheimer, and was briefly subject to some red scare vitriol.I also really questioned the historical accuracy of the whole thing in a particular scene where Oppenheimer is having a tryst with a communist portrayed by Florence Pugh. They start talking about Marx's Capital, how she's read all three volumes. He says ""possession is theft"" and she corrects him ""property is theft"" as supposedly a famous quote from the book. MASSIVE FACEPALM moment.Anyone with a modicum of knowledge about leftist history or Marx, would know that ""Property is Theft"" is a famous slogan from Pierre Joseph-Proudhon, an anarchist who Karl Marx once was friends with, but who he heavily criticized and basically tore apart in subsequent essay. Ever since the collapse of the first international, anarchists and Marxists have not seen eye to eye. No Marxist, let alone a CPUSA member in the 1930's, would be misquoting Marx with Proudhon. This was either a glaring oversight, OR deliberate trolling on the part of Nolan. I'm not sure.Either way, it brings into question the accuracy and the underlying message of the rest of the film. Nolan has included a lot of counter-revolutionary themes in his Dark Knight trilogy, and even hinted at being a closet Tory, so I don't trust him to portray Oppeheimer's saga accurately. I found a lot of similar issues with Aaron Sorkin's dreadful Lucille Ball biopoc. The idea of both films seems to be to ""rescue"" the legacy of these iconic figures by exorcising their communist flirtations as naïve youthful indiscretions. All the while ignoring the reasons why communism was so en vogue in the first half of the 20th century.There are a lot of other issues that I could talk about how general Leslie Groves, portrayed by Matt Damon, was made to look like a an gruff but affable ally and good friend of Oppenheimer. By some accounts, they were much more at odds with each other, and some even suspected Groves of being a fascist (people sometimes forget, with all the focus on communist witch hunts, how many fascists and Nazis were in the US at the same time, even in positions of power of prominence). Of course Groves pushed through Oppenheimers security clearance, not because he liked him, or even trusted him, but because he knew that he was their only chance of developing the a-bomb and beggars couldn't afford to play purity politics.Wait til this movie hits streaming to see it, and definitely read some books. Don't take these biopics at face value as real history.",Oppenheimer
5.0,One word to sum up this movie : Easy.,Lukrash,25 July 2023,"I was really looking forward to watching this movie. Great cast, great global hype, and the feeling that it wants to go further than just a ""girly"" Barbie movie.As a matter of fact, I was quite disappointed. While the message that is carried in this film is really important, I think that it was just to easy. It only talked about things we already knew, and not in a subtile or in a new way. I think it could have been so much more interesting and impactful. The scenario is also easy, you already know how it is going to end in the first 15 minutes. No surprises.Nevertheless, I must mention the great cast, costumes, sets and music. But in the end, it's just a colorful feel-good movie, that is empty inside. Mid. 5/10.",Barbie
9.0,Wonderful movie but not for everyone,OmarHussein005,21 July 2023,"This movie is amazing, like really amazing and a masterpiece and not a disappointment from christopher Nolan. Howerver the movie is not for everyone, its sophisticated and not all people will grasp it from the beginning. It's twisting and you have to concentrate with everything begind said, every name and every character in the movie because this movie is like a puzzle and you put the pieces together to get the full picture. 3 hours long and really slow rhythm and that's it's only draw back. Sone dialogues were boring in parts of the movie but once you finish the movie you will realise that these boring parts were needed but towards the end the rhythm is accelerated and that was necessary. People who like the spoon like info and pop corn movies would definitely say that this was a bad movie and would give it a 1-3/10 but that would be a disgrace for the movie. And RDJ was giving the performance of his life. It is an oscar performance and he is going to be a strong nominee. Overall this movie can only be watched in the cinema because at home, you will never get the magic of it. The black and white scenes were my favourite in this movie.",Oppenheimer
5.0,Wanted to love this,Pandy1,28 July 2023,"There's not a single moment without background score, except for the bomb explosion. It always bothers me when a film requires background music for everything, even quiet conversations, that nothing is good enough to survive without musical support. Also bleach bypassing IMAX seems a real waste - why use a lab process that increases grain and reduces contract ratio on the highest resolution film medium available? It all feels pretty one note, style over substance. Dry. Given Nolan's limitless resources it should be much more rounded. I didn't care about anyone, or even really get to know anyone, including Oppenheimer. Overall really disappointing and all the glowing reviews to me feel like everyone has drunk the Kool Aid. The emperor has no clothes. Not sure how much I'm influenced by having read the biography it's based on. Dr George Miller used to say that a film should feel like a great piece of music with highs, lows, quiet, crescendos, pacing. This feels like one very long chorus, and not a great one at that.",Oppenheimer
6.0,Bomb scene was so bad. Made the rest of the movie disappointing.,itsoferrall,23 July 2023,"The bomb scene was so overhyped it killed the rest of the movie for me.Now I think of Nolan as a pretentious guy. Dude didn't want to use CGI and instead used whatever he used to make a real bomb. Such a dud. The impact of the movie was severely deflated by that weak showing of a atom bomb. I was so looking forward to feel the extreme feelings of seeing that bomb that the the movie was leading up to and it was so bad. Really so bad. Mushroom cloud, no ring, no devastation. The light wasn't that bright. Insane that a movie can be so hyped up over one scene and the scene was absolute crap.Shame on Christopher Nolan. CGI would have been better.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Important Movie,morganoppoak,22 July 2023,"A very important movie because it tells the most important story in the history of mankind, which is the story of the nuclear bomb, but it does not tell the story of the bomb, but rather the one who invented this bomb, who is Robert Oppenheimer, who played the role of Cillian Murphy, who gave an Oscar performance And he gave us wonderful psychological acting scenes, and the other actor, Robert Downey Jr., who gave the best performance in his career, Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, and all the actors performed their roles wonderfully, but the defect of this movie is that it is complicated. In explaining the nuclear bomb and during the talk of the scientists it will make you somewhat distracted and the second negative is that I was waiting for a movie by Nolan such as Interstellar or Inception, but I found myself in front of a biographical movie with the fingerprint of Christopher Nolan But I enjoyed the movie even though I expected more from this movie and it is definitely the best movie of the year so far But it includes some boredom and suffers from the long time in the elephant.",Oppenheimer
9.0,"""They won't fear it until they understand it. And they won't understand it until they've used it. Theory will take you only so far.""",yasinhussain-14721,23 July 2023,"Oppenheimer (2023) chronicles the true story of J. Robert Oppenheimer (Cillian Murphy), his involvement in the Manhattan Project, and the events that unfolded in the aftermath.Wow wow wow, where do I begin? Let's start with the cast shall we? Because they were exceptional. Cillian was marvellous throughout and RDJ (as Lewis Strauss) was seriously outstanding, especially towards the end in that one particular scene (you guys probably know which scene I'm talking about if you've seen the movie). Now I can see what people were talking about when they said his performance was Oscar-worthy. Cillian's is too to be fair, let me just make that clear. Even the likes of Emily Blunt (as Kitty Oppenheimer) and Florence Pugh (as Jean Tatlock) were genuinely amazing in their albeit smaller roles. And boy, I knew the cast was stacked but not this stacked. Many of the other supporting actors were fantastic too: Rami Malek (as David Hill), Tom Conti (as Albert Einstein), David Dastmalchian (as William Borden), Dane DeHann (as Kenneth Nichols), Benny Safdie (as Edward Teller), Alden Ehrenreich (as Richard Feynman), David Krumholtz (as Isidor Isaac Rabi), and perhaps more who I don't think are being given enough praise.The score. Oh my god the score. Huge credit to Ludwig Göransson because it was absolutely breathtaking, and it really got my heart racing. The VFX and SFX were mesmerising and utterly riveting, even if they were a little overdone in my opinion. The sound wasn't perfect though. Even though you could actually hear the dialogue in this film (unlike Christopher Nolan's other movies), I still would've liked the music to be a little quieter so that we could hear it more clearly. Also, some of the sounds were... weird. During the Trinity Test it sounds like someone's shuffling out of bed, I'm not exaggerating, I honestly think that's how they got the sound, but why not just use the actual sound?? As a result of Nolan's stupidity, it made me laugh during what was supposed to be perhaps the most intense scene in the entire picture. But I digress, since either way, I would still expect this to win the Best Sound and Best Original Score Oscars, that's how good the audio was, seriously.In case you're wondering if the movie drags, considering it's a 3 hour picture, for me I would say it does a bit during the closed hearing scenes after The Trinity Test, but I was so engrossed in the film that I was loving it regardless. Some people might say that the first hour or so where we get to know about Oppenheimer's background before joining the Manhattan Project drags too, but for some reason I loved it. There wasn't even anything in particular about that part of the movie that you would say was entertaining per se, but seeing it in the theater, added with the thrilling score in the background, I guess just made me feel so immersed that no matter what was on screen, I was relishing it.Just to warn you, this picture is not necessarily in chronological order. There's a lot of flash forwards and flash backs. Think of it as two different timelines, which Nolan switches between at various points in the movie. Nolan actually tries to make this clear at the start by numbering each timeline 1 and 2, but even then, the less eagle-eyed amongst you may struggle to get a complete grasp on things, so just make sure you're paying attention. I personally managed to understand what was going on and because of that I actually really liked the two timelines thing, it makes this feature stand out compared to any ordinary film. It also made me quickly realise that this isn't just about the tragedies caused by the Manhattan Project, which is what my impression was from the trailer. There's a reason it's called Oppenheimer. It's about him, his story, his perspective of the Manhattan Project, so it's good that this was made explicit from very early on.But why am I giving this a 9 and not a 10? Because this isn't what I expected. This isn't what I wanted from this feature. After the bombings, I wanted to see a lot lot more on Oppenheimer's realisation at the calamities he has caused. I wanted devastation. Instead, the events after were predominantly about the hearing, which is a shame. This picture really should've focused on the immorality and tragedy of it all. Yes, we did get a little bit of that, but not enough. I expected to feel emotional myself when going to watch this, but no. I'm slightly disappointed as a result, because I wanted to feel heartbroken, I wanted that hard-hitting impact which I was craving, but it never arrived.But having said all that, this was absolutely spectacular, a one-of-a-kind movie. You have GOT to watch this in cinemas before it is too late. It's an unmissable cinematic experience. I cannot stress that enough.",Oppenheimer
8.0,THOROUGHLY ENJOYED,misterkayr,26 July 2023,"Loved it loved it loved it.It's so funny, i was clapping, shrieking, cheering the characters on several times. The movie is just after my own heart, as far as the actual theme and message is concerned. I sympathise wholeheartedly with women's cause and can't thank Greta Gerwig enough for bringing this fresh new take on worldview at least on silver screen.Will Ferrell is awesome here, his unique comedy gels so well with the funny theme that the movie has adopted. Simu Liu, Ryan Gosling were stars here. Loved what greta did with the narrative. It's so cool and unexpected and refreshing and did i mention Funny !?**I was only left wishing Kate McKinnon had a meatier role and more impactful presence. Barbie is awesome. Everyone of them.Would i watch it again? Yes, in a year's time. Great show ⭐ ⭐⭐⭐",Barbie
8.0,Hilarious and Thoughtful,talking_about_movies,22 July 2023,"This is actually very close to a great movie. It deserves your time and money at the theatres. Remember Lego Movie? How no one was expecting anything from it, labelling it as a cash grab? And it actually turned out to be a thoughtful, clever comedy? This movie is just as good.This is a fun, over the top, laugh out loud comedy that manages to communicate a very necessary message. I loved how much fun it had in doing that. It used comedy as a tool to prove its point. It's not easy guys. Making a satire itself is not easy, let alone turning Barbie into a good movie.The over-the-top way this movie made fun of sexism was hilariously genius. It reminded me of ""Don't Look Up"". That was another movie that deliberately made its characters unrealistically unlikeable to prove its point using humour. There are dialogues in this movie where I was like, it's funny but yeah, it needed to be said. The way this movie constantly made jabs at where gender equality stands at the moment, was genius.Everyone in this movie is having so much fun. The actors, all of them gave hilarious performances. Ryan Gosling, especially, was so funny. His character was so integral to the main theme of this movie.This movie is so self aware, that I wouldn't have been surprised if a character just mentioned the opening weekend battle with Oppenheimer.It has a few problems though. While the way the main theme of this movie is concluded was more or less perfect, I thought the way Barbie's character was concluded didn't make much sense and was sort of contradictory. And given that it's a very over the top comedy, some scenes do stretch a bit too much. It can get a bit too preachy at times too.But honestly, I had a great time. I would highly recommend watching this in theatres. In fact, my entire hall was laughing throughout the movie.",Barbie
10.0,"Christopher Nolan gives us a brilliant drama with Cillian Murphy giving us his best performance yet, one of the best films of the decade - My Ultimate Review",Holt344,26 July 2023,"My expectations are always high for a film made by Christopher Nolan who oversees the whole production whilst directing and writing it, he never lets me down and for this feature film, a biopic about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, a theoretical physicist who was pivotal in developing the first nuclear weapons as part of the Manhattan Project, and thereby ushering in the Atomic Age. What we get is a three hour biopic of Oppenheimer's life and in my opinion each minute and each scene is used to the fullest. My girlfriend thought it was too long though so I think it's a preference. You could say the black and white scenes which have a different perspective character entirely, to be unnecessary for the story told and that's fair, but in my opinion it's a perspective character which is needed. Stories can easily become biased but with a perspective character like Strauss makes us see how others see Robert Oppenheimer and it only helps the story Christopher Nolan is telling. Any fan of Christopher Nolan knows how he likes a non linear story, he does it here and It's done perfectly. Alternating between Oppenheimer's story from Cambridge to Los Alamos, his security hearing in 1954, and Strauss' confirmation hearing in 1959.Cillian Murphy stars as J. Robert Oppenheimer, with Emily Blunt as Oppenheimer's wife Katherine ""Kitty"" Oppenheimer; Matt Damon as General Leslie Groves, director of the Manhattan Project; and Robert Downey Jr. As Lewis Strauss, a senior member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. The ensemble supporting cast includes Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Casey Affleck, Rami Malek, Jason Clarke, Gary Oldman, Kenneth Branagh and Benny Safdie. The cast is full of phenomenal actors, each portraying a real figure. Nolan even got Matt Damon out of taking a break from acting, Damon's role in the film is far from the best I've seen but I'm certain he did a terrific job portraying General Groves. The best performance goes to Cillian Murphy, hands down. He has been in multiple of Christopher Nolan's films and lots of others, but never in a leading role like this. Peaky Blinders were always the best performance which I have seen of his, but that changed with his role of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Portraying a person who has existed and one with the reputation of Oppenheimer, makes it you either fail or succeed. I'm sure Cillian Murphy nailed each mannerism, you see it through his performance how he pays respect to the real figure, for example the weight loss. He should be nominated for best actor and as it looks like right now, win multiple awards for the performance, the best performance of his career or so is my opinion. Other performances which I really liked and found memorable, Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon to name a few. Though brief, Tom Conti was terrific as Albert Einstein and I could easily see a biopic be made with him in the role.Christopher Nolan did it again, a film which is looking to be a huge box office success and he does it in a way which seems oddly new to Hollywood, Nolan never changed as it was Hollywood who did. I'm of course talking about the over-reliance of CGI and visual effects. The big explosion in the film which is as real as you can get without actually blowing up a real atomic bomb, he uses practical effects and creates a stunning looking film because of it. You get immersed and the thought of things being fake never crosses your mind, because it aren't. Of course there's CGI in the film but used sparingly like the shots in space. It's a visually striking movie which Nolan has made and the IMAX only makes it so much grander. Ludwig Göransson is yet again working with Christopher Nolan and I can say they're a brilliant duo. Nolan had advised him to use the violin for Oppenheimer's central theme in the film, with Göransson remarking that he had felt that it could go from ""the most romantic, beautiful tone in a split second to neurotic and heart wrenching, horror sounds"". This might be Ludwig's best musical score, it just might.Christopher Nolan began writing the script for Oppenheimer after he had finished Tenet, he had been envisioning the film for over 20 years before that. A primary theme of Oppenheimer is dealing with the consequences of Oppenheimer's actions, with Nolan opting to explore how consequences can affect people in a delayed manner as he felt people are not ""necessarily confronted with the strongest or worst elements of your action in the moment"". I just think it's a fantastic screenplay, it also worked very well with it being written in first person which was a first for the director. The writing is perfect, like so much else. If I should find something to criticize, I would say the writing for its female characters. But honestly, it's alright, I don't mind and my girlfriend didn't mind either. This is a film about Oppenheimer, we get to see the story through his eyes and his eyes only, except for Robert Downey Jr's character.Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times awarded Oppenheimer a perfect four out of four stars, describing it as ""magnificent"" and ""one of the best films of the 21st century"". Many critics share his opinion and honestly, I do too. Oppenheimer is on my top three films of Nolan's, The Dark Knight remains my favorite, but this is close to that. This might be one of the best films I've seen in the last year or two and I agree fully with ""one of the best films of the 21st century"".",Oppenheimer
10.0,A HONEST REVIEW,officialerrt,21 July 2023,People who followed all the lawsuits and all the Barbies throughout the years. It broke every single Hollywood Law in the books. Mattel made Satire out of their own overprotection of the Barbie Product. Margot Robbie was a breath of fresh air when she produced and starred in Barbie. This is one movie for both males and females and those who absolutely HATE Barbie. It is pure comedy and will never stop laughing throughout the whole movie.Know your Barbie History before coming to the movie. Know the lawsuits which Mattel brought to those who used Barbie as Satire. 64 years of history in.one hour and fifty-four minutes.,Barbie

10.0,"There are good films, great films and there's masterpieces. This is the latter.",ChrisMartins1973,21 July 2023,"Christopher Nolan has created something truly unique. A biopic that is deep, intense, emotional, complex, makes you think, and actually hits you physically through sound... At least in Imax...This is a movie for the ages.

The casting is simply A++ list, including a few surprises, and they're all on their A++++ game... Robert Downey Jr delivers like his life depended on it, Hartnett reminds you of why he was such a hot topic back in the day, Damon is perfect, and Murphy...

9.0,Barbie for one and all,ghettofabtoast,20 July 2023,"This movie was amazing both in the commentary it set out to say and the jokes. I'm not gonna beat around the Malbui dream house, the casting was on point and the references to some of the more obscure Barbie lore was appreciated. Ken also has some pretty fun scenes as well.Now listen I've already seen reviews about how some people aren't happy about the commentary in the movie. Well guess what maybe that's the issue then. We have movies about war but that doesn't mean we are saying war is good. Overall I think there are alot of people who wanted this to be a comedy so bad that they missed the very obvious signs in the trailer that it was going to be more then that. The comedy is there to soften the slap of reality that yes women are still objectified and they aren't going to sugar coat it.If this movie pisses you off because you think the plot is ""men bad, women good"" then you missed the point of Ken's story line and how he grew as a person. Grow up and learn to see beyond your 'Barbieland' where everything it's perfect for you cause it's not.",Barbie

4.0,"An comment about feminism, men & gender equality",hanschsolo,23 July 2023,"An film that tries to balance out humor and leaving social criticism in the minds of the viewers. Barbie falls flat with its criticism not only because it feels flat and out of place, but most importantly unnatural and unimportant.Why does a film about a female toy that kids play with need to comment on feminism. The use of feminism is to give a woman the right to choose for themselves and to be what they want, for example no woman nowadays should be a housewife if they do not want it to be. There are still current problems such as loans, the pay gap shouldn't be a thing, that is where gender equality is important, but Barbie gets it wrong and simply criticizes the mental state of being a woman and having it hard in its own life and still try to cover it up and being controlled by men. While I know that this is a problem in some cultures and countries, it is not the ones that people watch this film in. And Barbie definitely doesn't means it in that way.Ken plays the stereotypical men, he wants to rule and fulfill himself in his life, and he searches for meaning. His character development ends with him needing to let go of Barbie to truly find himself, and Barbie says that he wasn't created only to be Barbie's boyfriend, but truly, he was. No one bought a ken toy without a Barbie toy, so why can't we let the toys that girls play with, be toys they play with?Barbie sees the Real world as an issue because she thinks it only gets controlled by men, but she doesn't see that barbie land is a place which has a woman dictatorship.I was prepared for an fun time with laughs, but was rather left devastated by this film, because it tries to criticize how we treat feminism and gender equality, but then it gets it wrong, and finds problems where they is none. It rather comes across as the message, woman are good, men are bad. This is not the type of film that would inspire a little girl to be something special, this is the type of film she doesn't even understand or care for.",Barbie

9.0,"Powerful, intricate film",blairvcarpenter,23 July 2023,"The subject matter of this film is immense, intense, and powerful. With Christopher Nolan at the helm and Cillian Murphy anchoring the film, they more than met the emotion and gravitas needed to anchor the story. Every detail was accounted for: the practical effects, sets, and costumes grounded the film necessarily. The impact of the sound mixing, makeup, and score cannot be understated - this may be one of the great scores.The story was INCREDIBLY complex. Drawn from Dr. Oppenheimer's biography directly, it's clear there were likely some heated production meetings determining which details were precious and relevant enough to keep. While every element contributed to the overall portrait of the man, it was occasionally to the detriment of the editing. The beginning portion of the film was edited so tightly and quickly it felt like a trailer, and therefore many early elements (such as Florence Pugh's portrayal of Jean Tatlock) were not allowed room to breathe.The casting included giant after giant. Movie lovers will get a little thrill each time a new giant or up-and-comer appears in a supporting role. The only odd piece was Rami Malek - though his character ended up playing an important role, his distinctive looks and his particular charisma stuck out even amongst a heavy-hitting cast.Emily Blunt in particular proved she's far more than a pretty face as the fierce, volatile Kitty Oppenheimer. Others, like David Krumholtz and Josh Peck, are signaling a new direction in their career that could yield promising results.Overall it's a superb execution of a complicated portrait of a complicated man.",Oppenheimer
10.0,"This is an mportant movie, hilarious, joyful and profound",todorstef,19 July 2023,"It is a philosophical masterpiece. Clever and thought provoking, hilarious and modern. I didn't expect that at all. The constructed reality is as complex as if Morpheus from ""the Matrix"" offered you the third pill which conjoins two worlds. Deserves the hypeI hope I don't dive super deep here, if I say that the beginning reminds me of Wlater Benjamin's ""Berlin Childhood"". Playing with toys knows to be joyful and lucid, but really reats some new and confusing ""realty"". To add up, this movie seems to be much more philosophical than ""The Matrix"", I would say. That dimension opens up right afterer ""blue pill vs red pill"" reference was made, because here we hd those two realities colide, ""imagenary"" and ""real*, creating the conjoined ""third realm"" where we see how both realites influence and shape each other. As Slavoj Zizek once pointed out: ""we need a third pill"", so here it is.At that point in the movie, story takes a new turn bringing into the focus some familiar social & existential struggles of modern times, providing us with its own critique of it. And it llooks like they had great success doing it. Seemingly effortlessly, they manged to bring out some greater point, keeping the great dynamics, adding the great amount of comedy to it. That was actually so impressive.Here ill pull the breaks, I would rather not to try to explain the movie or interprete it, .. Just wanna to say in the end that I strongly rrecommend it for watching. It's fun, profound, its reveling and bringing out so many different layers talking about the social/existential dilemas and actually you can learn much from watching it. And In the end, it gives the right amount of optimism.",Barbie
7.0,Barbie,CinemaSerf,26 July 2023,"""Thus Spake Zarabarbie"" - that's the opening message as narrated by Dame Helen Mirren who gives us a potted history of the doll - from it's origins as an inanimate plaything of young girls to it's current status as an empowering conduit for young girls to emerge into society as uninhibited and aspirational beings with only the sky as the limit. Well, that's the philosophy in Margot Robbie's ""Barbieland"". A sterile sort of environment that lives it's life along the lines of a pink ""Groundhog Day"". Men? Well yes, there are - as embodied by the tanned, rippled and toned ""Ken"" (Ryan Gosling) but they are very much the in-app purchase in this world, with little purpose aside from augmenting a ""Barbie"". Strangely, one morning, the stereotypical ""Barbie"" finds she has lost some of her charm! She is flat footed, her endlessly elysian existence is fraying at the edges? What do do? See ""Weird Barbie"" (Emerald Fennell) and seek her sagely advice. That, however, she doesn't like. She must enter into the real world and find whoever is supposed to be playing with her - clearly not an happy girl - and see if she can cheer her up and restore the equilibrium. En route, she finds that her ever devoted ""Ken"" will join her and their arrival in the big city introduces both to a bewildering world of sexists, misogynists and cynics. The latter best exemplified by ""Sasha"" - her somewhat disenchanted owner. When the boss of Mattel (Will Farrell) discovers her escape, he mobilises the whole of his organisation to get her back in her box whilst an equally disillusioned but newly engaged ""Ken"" heads back to his home realising that maybe the men don't have to live quite such understudy lives. Can she elude her pursuers long enough to befriend ""Sasha"", her much less cyclical mother ""Gloria"" (America Ferrera) and then get home before both of her world's are alien to her? This is good fun, this. Gosling is a talented actor who can also churn out a decent power ballad (there are a few) and there is the oddest of chemistries here between him and an very much on-form Robbie who puts her heart and her soul (and loads of joyous/bemused facial expressions) into this role. Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach have written a witty script that pitches the naive and the innocent in with the venal and the observational. It swipes at all things sexist - and not just from the woman's perspective either - and though it does ridicule the restrictions society has put on the historical progression of women through the ranks of corporate America, it does so in a positive and enjoyable satirical manner. Will Ferrell - I can take him or leave him - is really only adequate as the epitome of the male dominated company structure but there is quite a nice set of scenes with Rhea Perlman (for ever ""Carla"" from ""Cheers!"") who portrays the inventor - if that is the word - of the whole ""Barbie"" concept, and who knits it all nicely together towards the end. Don't be a snob about this, get yourself into a cinema and prepare to be entertained. Bergman it isn't, but an enjoyable evaluation and parody of 21st century life, opportunity and all things vacuous it certainly is.",Barbie
8.0,A fun ride!,Diae_lamiri,21 July 2023,"This movie was such great experience to live. It's a fun, entertaining, deep, and amazing piece of art. It was very funny at times, made me cry other times, and made me feel nostalgic and warm and proud and all of these different feelings. But most importantly it made me think! I really love it when movies discuss topics that matter and shake your ideas a little bit. I loved the cast, the costume designs, the music and everything in between. Margot Robbie is a queen, her acting was amazing and she's just the perfect cast for this role. Also, Ryan did an amazing job and so did the rest of the cast. Judging by the propaganda that surrounded it and the hype around it I didn't have high expectations but honestly I was pleasantly surprised.

9.0,One ticket to OPPENHEIMER please!,hasheerghafoor,21 July 2023,"Oppenheimer was one of my most anticipated movies of the year! Why? It's directed by my favorite director ever: Christopher Nolan. He has never made a bad movie, makes consistently good movies, and gives the audience original and unique films for their jaw to drop! I love this movie! It's very dialogue heavy, well paced, beautifully shot, amazing music score, Oscar worthy acting, and a fantastic script! This film will definitely get nominated for a bunch of Oscars and I hope it wins a lot of them! Cillian Murphy is absolutely stupendous! This is his best performance to date as I do see an Oscar nomination coming his way. Emily Blunt and Robert Downey Jr. Are also excellent as I also see nominations coming their way! This film would not have been as great if not for the performances because basically everyone gives a performance to not be forgotten! Nolan breaks down this film into three different acts which work so well. The story structure is very smooth although it can be hard to follow during the last act. I was invested from start to end and I was really surprised with how well the dialogue was written! It didn't disappoint as it's my current MOVIE OF THE YEAR!",Oppenheimer
1.0,Great potential ruind by poiticising everything,jitudaimari,23 July 2023,"Great costumes and set, but the Barbie land was not fully exposed instead they chose to make every single scene in the movie a political stand. After half an hour is stared to feel like ever other generic Hollywood movies. Everyone in the movie theatre was trying so hard to enjoy the movie, but all there expectations were crushed. No one laughed at the supposedly funny scenes. It was a dread. Dude people go to a Barbie movie to have fun, we have social media to preach about political issues everyday. Everyone fighting for every minute sign of offensive remarks. News anchors and politicians virtue signalling. Where will people go to have fun, Hollywood deserve to go broke.",Barbie
8.0,A Hoot!,missperea,26 July 2023,"This Barbie script, IMHO, is packed on so many levels of thought - on were we are today and how we got there. To those who trash it, I say, ""Lighten up Francis.""Everyone plays their part uniquely and with verve. And the set alone should be considered for an Oscar. We needed this movie for the sake of sanity... too much politicking has clouded the atmosphere.To all those who grew up with Barbie, Ken, and G. I. Joe, I hope you remember that it was a time for childlike innocence to play and have fun.There is truth in comedy... just ask Aristophanes.Reflect on it.Note: The reference to Kubrick's 2001 (1968) is absolutely hysterical.",Barbie
10.0,The most delight movie for me,geantarobert,26 July 2023,"In this movie you can see deep meaning sense of live, you need to know just little things before or to be open mind and the whole univers will show appear for you. Most of scenes have a hidden or deep mening, i am not going to write too much about movie because i am here to sustain Greta Gerwing and i am very grateful for her because she had the creep to made it. Maybe more director will do movies for our souls not just for action,adventure,etc...For me it was the greatest movie who I saw it ever. Any people should see through rows and see the true meaning of the movie. All my best to the Greta Gerwig <3.",Barbie

The destroyer of worlds""",raulvg-31151,22 July 2023,"Without further ado, ladies and gentlemen: CHRISTOPHER NOLAN REACHED PERFECTION!The film is the masterpiece of art that cinema tends to be only on rare occasions. One of the rare occasions was on Interstellar, but here... here it went beyond. This is the purest perfection Nolan has achieved.Is a film that will revolutionize cinema, as will almost all films by the same director. The script is amazing, perfect! Makes 3 hours of film feel like 5 minutes!The performances are A-M-A-Z-I-N-G, even from the lead to the extra, everyone in the film deserves the biggest spotlight. My prediction, which will probably be correct, is that Oppenheimer will be the frontrunner for the next Oscar. The performance of everyone in the project brings immersion and many different compliments.The art and sound direction, then, doesn't just deserve applause, they deserve an entire orchestra of celebrations to them!I've already convinced myself that Cillian Murphy, Florence Pugh and Robert Downey Jr. Will be the Oscar winners for best actor, actress and supporting actor.The film revolutionizes, animates, excites... this is art.

8.0,"I hope this ""oppenheimer"" is much better than the previous ""tenet""",antoniocasaca123,26 July 2023,"The truth is that Christopher Nolan is an excellent director, presenting us with extremely ambitious, interesting and successful themes in his films.All his films are good (with the exception, in my opinion, of ""tenet"" (too much ambition sometimes doesn't work) and ""dunkirk"" (very good technically but with completely empty characters, making it impossible to empathize with any of them)).I said before that ""all of Nolan's films are good"": Trilogy ""batman"", ""inception"", ""the prestige"", ""interstellar"", ""memento"", etc., etc.But none is magnificent, none is masterpiece. Not even close. When will have a magnificent film from Nolan? When will so many people stop saying that Christopher is an ""overrated"" director?It will be with this ""oppenheimer"" that finally is Nolan truly going to ""kill it"" once and for all?I hope so! He (Christopher Nolan) deserves it.I gave all CN films an 8/10, with the exception of the aforementioned ""tenet"" and ""dunkirk"", which I gave a 7/10. I look forward to giving it a 9!All that's missing is a leap to ""magnificent"" instead of ""good"".",Oppenheimer
8.0,"Hey Twitter, lets go party!",raulvg-31151,20 July 2023,"Sorry for the title, militants, please don't cancel me! (seriously, jokes aside) While the movie is good, I anticipate a lot of memes about overblown cancellations, prejudice, and patriarchy... which I think get a lot of attention from the script. More than was needed.The movie is fun and has great performances, hats off to Margot Robbie, but, Ryan Gosling and Simu Liu's Kens stole every scene. The rest of the acting and cast is just fine, I don't believe I've seen a single bad performance.For a particularly comedy film, I feel like my session lacked laughs. Throughout the film, I laugh in very few scenes, but I also understand that they are directed at children and so on. (ignoring the last part, there are some jokes with double meanings, nothing that children would understand, watch it calmly with the little ones!)...but I have to admit, the movie didn't get me. Actually, it was one of the few times that I almost fell asleep in the cinema. This time, me and my company, we yawned so much that we started to cry from sleep, but we didn't pass out. The reason i'm writing this last part is because i can understand the 1/10 and the 10/10 reviews... it just hits people in different ways. The only bad thing this movie did is make me sick of the color pink. Seriously, the theater was packed with people wearing only pink.

6.0,Barbie Impresses in an Interesting Way,j-mayo1999,21 July 2023,"Barbie, while not something I would typically watch, caught my interest. I watched the trailer and felt as though this would not be a typical kids movie. The humor surprised me as I laughed multiple times. The cameos were great. The main cast was perfectly cast. Ryan Gosling shined as Ken. I was overall pleased with the movie.I will say that the humor is catered to parents in some aspects. The kids also have humor that they will enjoy. This movie is mainly for preteen/teenagers. Some parents of kids that are 10 years of age or younger may find the movie offensive.Overall, solid movie with a great cast and a good script. No doubt a movie that was need for this summer's box office.",Barbie
1.0,How does the Barbie movie have good ratings? How?!,kim_shea_berg,23 July 2023,"First, I can't believe I went to this movie. My 18 year old daughter wanted to go so I said ok. I watched the first 20 minutes in disbelief - with my internal voice asking, ""How did this movie ever get made?"" The story is stupid. The acting is bad. The movie tries to be a cross between The Wizard of Oz, La La Land, Being John Malkovich and The Truman Show but fails on all attempts. Is it a musical, comedy, drama, spoof? Yes to all. But again, it fails miserably on all attempts. Oh - and have I mentioned how we women are supposed to be superior to men? Like the Woo Girls in HIMYM, it's just sad. I'll never get my time or money back, so I recommend you just save your money and go see something else. I just can't believe this film has good reviews. It must me a new way to market films - pay a whole bunch of people to talk it up and write good reviews on social media, and then you'll get the crowds on opening weekend. You've been warned.",Barbie
10.0,A masterpiece made by women for women.,cathimaria,22 July 2023,"Barbie will be a pioneer and a classic in the film world. She shatters all expectations and supersedes all standards. She is incredibly insightful, touching, truthful, whimsical. Barbie is made by women for women. To any man who ""doesn't get it"", you wont, but I invite you to watch it anyways as a show of support to women and our lived experiences and our dreams and hopes.To the men who feel attacked by this film, please feel attacked. This is an attack on men and rightfully so. Barbie doesn't stretch the truth or make a mockery, she puts life on the screen exactly how it is. Barbie is a mirror.And once again to the men who feel like ""this isn't for me"". If you are a heterosexual male attracted to women, the logical conclusion is to celebrate and enjoy femininity, to express curiosity, care and interest for women.

10.0,Arguably the best movie of the year,arjunkasawatia,25 July 2023,"In a year that saw the release of movies like John Wick and Mission Impossible, Oppenheimer stands out as a shining gem. Throughout its 3 hour duration, I found myself literally on the edge of my seat, immersed in a well-crafted storyline and a stellar cast.Without revealing too much, the highly anticipated nuke scene was executed with perfection, leaving pretty much everyone satisfied...The performances of cillian murphy, RDJ, and matt damon were nothing short of Oscar-worthy. Notably, Nolan provided RDJ with an opportunity to showcase his acting prowess, breaking away from the role he had portrayed for a decade, and he delivered magnificently.The film boasts beautiful cinematography, and Ludwig's masterpiece original score keeps you engrossed throughout the entire movie.My suggestion is to refrain from reading reviews and simply go watch the movie, as it is definitely worth it. If possible, opt for the best screen available, such as a 15/70 IMAX or some other form of IMAX, to fully immerse yourself in the experience.",Oppenheimer

I decided to see it a 2nd time at a different theater not in IMAX and honestly I found the 2nd viewing to be more enjoyable and the film felt like it went faster this time as my mind was more awake and engaged and everything clicked for me. Nonetheless, this is one of the most important films ever made and I really hope it continues to get the praise it deserves.",Oppenheimer
6.0,There is a substance to this movie.,jaroslavadam,21 July 2023,"I read from many sources about Barbie being a hardcore feminist movie, just as bad as all recent Lucasfilm sludge. I'm happy to report it is not true.Barbie and Ken have their separate, but equal story arcs. Ken goes on adventure of self discovery and ultimately learns his value outside just being there just for Barbie.Barbie's part of the story lingers a lot on the paradox that she is meant to be an icon of emancipation, but is also blamed for setting the wrong standards and gets some hate for it.There are also real human characters, which are compelling at first, but rather simplistic.The storytelling frequently stops to explore and explain too many messages about society, equality, misogyny and troubles if growing up and being a woman or a mother.The writing has some problems, bad jokes and the last twelve minutes are utterly pointless. But overall it delivered what it promised in a very nice package.The sets and cinematography are top notch, as well as the acting.",Barbie

Legal proceedings just such a bore, shouldn't have been given this much significance, just flooded the movie, also I wasn't confident about where his wife's motivation comes from. For the first time ever I noticed this style of movie making that is present in this movie actually bothers me.

A other thing I liked about the movie was the opening scene lats just say it MIGHT BE Really FUNNY. There were a lot of scenes in this were the hole theater was lagging so loud l couldn't hear a thing.

9.0,Surprisingly good,yaacovn-26889,21 July 2023,"As a teenager I kinda just went to this movie because of all the hype and jokes on Instagram, TikTok etc. But surprisingly this movie was actually really good. Unsurprisingly Margot Robbie was phenomenal, and was the PERFECT choice for Barbie.When the movie first started I really didn't know what it was going to be, I thought it would just be a girly movie about dolls and feminists, and everything wrong with Hollywood nowadays, but this quickly proved otherwise. It had the perfect amount of jokes, (which were surprisingly funny) the plot was simple but entertaining . Toward the end of the movie it got really serious, and it really had me thinking about life in a way where I just want to get my life together and be a better person. In conclusion this movie was great and Greta Gerwig did an amazing job with the cast and the movie as a whole!!!",Barbie

The movie did not disappoint it exceeded all expectations, even though it was 3 hours , I wasn't bored for any it. It hooks you in with the sudden tone changes .

9.0,Spectacular!,UniqueParticle,22 July 2023,"Family/adult film mashed in really well! The trailer barely shows anything about how deep the movie is I really appreciate that! I'm sure production design will surely get recognition at the Oscars I love that they used so much pink they had to get more. I saw in RPX with my sister Emily which was quite spectacular except for several audience members that were obnoxious and barely seemed into the movie those people like that are strange.I probably laughed at more parts than most people and was engaged throughout. Perfect mix of kid story, The Matrix, and a lot more packed in really well! Greta Gerwig made an important film and plenty of charm for everyone involved. Lovable experience with a lot of important controversy that I didn't expect out of left field. I had most of this up already but deleted and edited out multiple things maybe this is better.",Barbie
10.0,"Laugh, Reflect, Repeat: Exploring the Wonders of 'Barbie'",sanadalsalt,27 July 2023,"Oh my goodness, where do I even begin with ""Barbie"" (2023)? This film is an absolute delight and a true masterpiece that will leave you in awe. Directed by the incredibly talented Greta Gerwig and starring the stunning Margot Robbie as the iconic doll herself, ""Barbie"" is a cinematic experience like no other.From start to finish, ""Barbie"" captivates audiences with its seamless blend of adventure, comedy, fantasy, and romance. Gerwig's direction is nothing short of brilliant as she brings the world of Barbie to life with a perfect balance of humor and depth. The humor, in particular, is off the charts hilarious, with giant laugh-out-loud moments that had me clutching my sides. It's remarkable how the humor appeals to viewers of all ages, making it one of the funniest movies of the year.But what truly sets ""Barbie"" apart is its profound and thought-provoking narrative. The film revolves around Barbie's existential crisis and her quest to find meaning in her existence. This exploration of Barbie's identity as a feminist symbol is incredibly compelling and challenges societal norms and expectations surrounding femininity and girlhood. Can a doll with impossibly perfect features and a smile of perpetual happiness truly embody feminist ideals? This deep, existential question lingers long after the credits roll, prompting introspection and discussion.Margot Robbie's performance as Barbie is nothing short of extraordinary. She brings a charisma and depth to the character that is truly captivating. Watching her journey of self-discovery unfold on screen is an absolute joy. And let's not forget Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Ken, which complements Robbie's Barbie perfectly. Their on-screen chemistry is off the charts and adds another layer of excitement to the film.I should mention that ""Barbie"" has received widespread acclaim from both critics and audiences, and it's easy to see why. It strikes a perfect balance between appealing to longtime fans and captivating new audiences. The movie's mass appeal transcends age, gender, and previous Barbie doll opinions, making it a delightful and engaging experience for viewers of all backgrounds.Despite its PG-13 rating, ""Barbie"" remains family-friendly and suitable for teenagers and older kids. The clever marketing of the film ensures that it appeals to a wide range of audiences, making it a perfect choice for family movie nights.In conclusion, ""Barbie"" is an absolute triumph in every aspect of filmmaking. With its stellar cast, innovative approach, brilliant humor, and profound exploration of societal themes, it more than deserves a perfect 10/10 rating. This cinematic gem is a must-watch for anyone seeking an enchanting and thought-provoking experience that transcends the boundaries of age and nostalgia. Brace yourself to be dazzled and captivated by the delightful world of ""Barbie."" Trust me, you won't be disappointed!",Barbie
1.0,Nothing but a good picture,vriskasuper,23 July 2023,"To tell the truth, I expected the film to be something more than a beautiful picture with good actors and some funny comedy pieces. Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, Kate McKinnon: they all are my favourite actors. That was actually the reason to buy a ticket. But the film did really disappointed me.I liked the costumes and decorations, the topic of feminism, some jokes and musicals...but the way it was used is pretty confusing.First of all, the topic of feminism could have been described more... natural? Not just a woman telling other women that they are more than just servants for their men. It's true. But... really? Just men's riot, crying women and yes finally the thought of feminism. It's so trite. And it's all just for about...five minutes??? You took more time for these musical pieces that meant nothing but a waste of time. You should have used the screen time not for silly men running around the office or people dancing around good decorations, but for talking about the real point of the film (men and women: their life can be really good even without each other, because all of them are independent creatures. Women are strong and can be everyone they want as well as men do).As for me, the film could have been more structured. It seems like the first thought a person got in the morning and wrote everything that was in the head. It doesn't work like that. You don't have any structure in your film, except for plot. You use some strange moments with dancing people or a crazy riding car like in forza horizon, but for what? Is it a blockbuster or musical? These are good and I love musicals and blockbusters moments, but when they are really useful in the case they are used in, but in the film I didn't see the point of these ""juicy moments"".For me...it was the toy story, but with Barbie and the worst not structured subsequence of actions. Sorry but you had some of the best actors, the topic of feminism, good decorations... and just made the film thoughtless.",Barbie
9.0,Nothing short of brilliant - could be a game-changer,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,23 July 2023,"Barbie is an anomaly, a force of nature, and could potentially be some sort of trendsetter in ways I can't quite fathom yet. I never expected a good Barbie movie to exist, especially not one that is so poignant and rich with satire, ambition, and intellect. But, this movie isn't just good - it's fantastic.Choosing to make ""facade"" one of the primary focuses of the film was probably the most brilliant thing that writer/director Greta Gerwig could have done, because it allows the movie to function as a wholly progressive and often quite meta experience. Though the movie only goes back and forth between Barbie Land and ""reality"", I felt as if I traversed through 5 or 6 different dimensions throughout the course of the film. The movie has so many layers, I'm not even sure how Gerwig made it work - maybe it was luck, maybe it was an incredibly talented cast & crew, or maybe she's just a genius.What's most important is that the movie is hilarious, all the way through. There weren't many segments where a giant smile was not plastered across my face. Though the choices for comedic roles could be perceived as cliche, all of them murdered the game with their characters, that being Michael Cera as Allan, Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie, and of course Will Ferrell as the CEO of Mattel. But, it's Ryan Gosling that truly steals the show as the funniest part of the entire film. Of course, it's the brilliant writing that allows it, but Gosling's commitment to bringing to life one of the greatest exaggerations of masculinity I have ever seen put to screen is diamond-level. The way the movie spotlights parallels between straight-guy masculinity and gayness, as both a joke and an astute observation, is incredible and done in a way I've never seen pulled off before.It should be said that what allows a comedy to transcend the bone-headed standards that the genre usually plants itself in, is a script that actually has something to say, from the heart and from the brain. I figured it would poke fun at certain gender tropes and politics, but I didn't expect Barbie to be full of so much existential philosophy. At times it almost felt like Charlie Kaufman LITE, but in a GOOD WAY. Though most of the film is full of laughs, it also has several segments that will suddenly take you to realms of sheer reflection and a surprising amount of emotional resonance. I think a lot of people had to get over an ""am I about to cry at a Barbie movie?"" hump, but...I want you to know that you should cry at this movie! It's both nostalgic and totally ahead of its time at the same time. It's actually a very serious and important film underneath all the pink & the laughs.And on that note, it's not surprising that so many dudes are already calling it a horrible movie and overly woke feminist propaganda, but it's definitely lame of them, and in my opinion, wrong. I think a lot of these people are missing a lot of the points and the jokes. Though on the surface the movie seems to be poking most fun at men, it pokes just as much fun at femininity, society, and the human experience as a whole. It has a lot of critical things to say about all of them. Plus, if you can't laugh at your own kind, especially when it's done so articulately, with so much love, I really think you're doing it all wrong.It comes as no surprise that Margot Robbie carries the film wonderfully. The soundtrack is also a ton of fun. But the most exciting part here, ""as a fan of the cinema"", is knowing that this is going to take Greta Gerwig to the absolute top of the totem pole. She's been such an interesting, tasteful, and likable multi-faceted presence, between acting, writing, and directing, and I'm very curious and excited to see what she does with her power after this.",Barbie
10.0,Movie is a feeling,rhythms-76883,22 July 2023,"Stop comparing Oppenheimer to anything at all what's important is everyone knowing the truth about J robert Oppenheimer, people are supporting a fictional character movie instead of a biography of the greatest person ever existed, his sufferings, the misbehave, the boycott, the pain, Oppenheimer changed the world, Oppenheimer ended world war, Oppenheimer invented the great thing ever to exist, but people think something else is more important than that, but people laughed in the hall where Oppenheimer was playing, the sad thing is that people don't even understand the movie this movie is a feeling.",Oppenheimer
8.0,Positively surprised,Ralifax,19 July 2023,"Addresses current critical issues; basically, the movie revolves around that. The central ideas are patriarchy and female empowerment, which I believe were handled intelligently and elegantly. I was particularly surprised in this regard; I didn't expect the film to be so mature.I also want to highlight the makeup, set, photography and choreography. Top-notch, flawless.The context is also interesting; the script is creative, and the story is engaging, making the film much more fluid. Personally that's what I liked the most, how the fantasy and the reality interact. The actors were amazing too, and not only the main characters.Some other human characters were underdeveloped compared to Barbie and Ken, but that was expected.As a man I recon that this is a movie that speaks to women, but also to men sensible to women struggles. I went to watch it without expecting more than a visually beautiful film, and I left the cinema positively surprised.",Barbie
9.0,See it in cinemas,EasyTiger,22 July 2023,"This film is made for the big screen. The sound design and cinematography are so good that it's a physical experience that left me with goosebumps.That said, it is an exhausting one. You feel the 3 hours and my adrenaline recovery took some time from the long build up which was, however, expertly delivered. Again, this is why this film was made for the big screen.There is some great acting, particularly from Cillian Murphy and with some surprisingly cameos - it's certainly one of Nolan's best works.The score is also worth mentioning, dropping his usual collaboration with Hans Zimmer, it was more minimalistic, gritty and perfectly interwoven with the storyline.If you plan on seeing Oppenheimer, get to the cinema if you can.",Oppenheimer
8.0,"Too long, but interesting. (Was there really some Dutch?!)",janwillemaikens,22 July 2023,"I liked the movie, the cast and characters and it was interesting. I don't know enough about the historic events to say if it's a correct reflection. Oppenheimer coping with guilt was wonderfully brought across. Contrast in loud sound and silence was impressive. Worth it to see it on cinema.Oppenheimer was speaking what I recognised as German, but it was explained to be Dutch. As a Dutch native speaker I didn't even recognise it. I am always surprised that in a million dollar budget, these little things that could be easily done right always seem to go wrong.In my opinion the end play was stretched a bit long. It may have been to get the history complete, but the 'plot' was explained at the end anyway. It gave me a bit of a Guy Ritchie feeling, turning the movie into a crime thriller. Making a 3 hour movie seems to be a goal for some directors.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Openheimer - A Mind-Bending Masterpiece,bibekrawat-40472,21 July 2023,"""Openheimer,"" the much-anticipated cinematic collaboration between visionary director Christopher Nolan and the incredibly talented actor Cillian Murphy, is an intellectually stimulating and visually captivating journey into the life and mind of one of the most enigmatic figures in history, J. Robert Oppenheimer. With this biographical drama, Nolan once again proves his prowess in delivering mind-bending narratives, while Murphy's performance shines as he fully embodies the complex character of Oppenheimer.The film delves into the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who led the Manhattan Project during World War II, leading to the development of the atomic bomb. But ""Openheimer"" is not your typical biopic. Nolan skillfully weaves together different timelines, exploring the tumultuous events of Oppenheimer's life in a non-linear fashion, much like a complex puzzle. This approach immerses the audience into the physicist's psyche, providing a glimpse of his thoughts, fears, and inner conflicts.Cillian Murphy's portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer is nothing short of mesmerizing. With nuance and depth, Murphy captures the brilliance and tormented soul of the scientist. He effortlessly portrays the internal struggles of a man torn between his love for science and the moral dilemmas arising from the destructive power he helped create. Murphy's ability to convey Oppenheimer's intellectual genius and emotional vulnerability makes the character highly relatable, despite the weighty decisions he faced.The supporting cast also deserves commendation, with exceptional performances from Anne Hathaway, who portrays Kitty Oppenheimer, and Michael Caine, taking on the role of Richard Tolman, a close friend and advisor to Oppenheimer. Their chemistry with Cillian Murphy enhances the emotional impact of the film and adds further layers to the complex narrative.As expected from a Christopher Nolan film, ""Openheimer"" boasts outstanding technical craftsmanship. Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is a visual feast, capturing both the grandeur of scientific discovery and the haunting consequences of humanity's actions. Hans Zimmer's evocative score elevates the film's emotional intensity, complementing the story's multi-layered structure.While ""Openheimer"" showcases the brilliance of its creators, it may not be a film for everyone. The non-linear storytelling style can be intellectually demanding, and some viewers might find themselves lost in the complexity of the narrative. However, for those willing to engage with the material and invest in unraveling the puzzle, the rewards are plentiful.In its exploration of ethics, the consequences of scientific progress, and the inner conflicts of a brilliant mind, ""Openheimer"" raises thought-provoking questions that linger long after leaving the theater. Nolan's deft direction and Murphy's tour de force performance make this film a must-see for cinephiles who crave intellectual stimulation and appreciate a visually striking cinematic experience.In conclusion, ""Openheimer"" is a mind-bending masterpiece that showcases the immense talent of Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy. As a biographical drama that challenges the traditional conventions of storytelling, it pushes the boundaries of what cinema can achieve. With its thought-provoking narrative, exceptional performances, and stunning visuals, ""Openheimer"" leaves a lasting impression and solidifies its place among the finest works of modern cinema.",Oppenheimer
9.0,Another Nolan masterpiece,harrymalsher,22 July 2023,"The tense, examination towards the end of the movie is one of the greatest plot points of a movie I have ever seen. One minor complaint, that stops it from being a 10/10, is the explosive audio towards the opening of the film, in a particular scene with RDJ the music was so loud that it made the dialogue of the scene unclear. Emily Blunt was an absolutely incredible portrayal of Kitty Oppenheimer, especially during the examination when Dr Oppenheimer is questioned with regards to his relationship with Jean the known communist, The movie moves at an absolutely beautiful pace, and did not feel like a 3 hour movie at all. A true masterpiece. In my opinion, this is a contender for the greatest film we will ever see. Nolan deserves praise.",Oppenheimer
8.0,I didn't like it - but it was still a masterpiece,srgymrat33,27 July 2023,"This movie was an aesthetic dream . Just looking at it was a treat . Scene to scene , color schemes , outfit choices . This kept you drawn in and you wanted to keep looking - even if you didn't like anything else - the straight up visual was worth it .The satire and political commentary was absolutely on point . This movie didn't try to hide what it was or what it was doing - it showed you trailer to finish and I loved that . There was nothing put in by accident - everything was thoughtful and served a purpose . This was true for every joke , every clothing choice , every character , every emotion ,The humor was funny - but this was my one complaint . I don't like crude humor and I am a prude and honestly some of it was crass . Nothing ""bad"" and I recognize I am a grinch in that way - I laughed but this was the reason I would not watch it over and over , just don't value that type of joke . But I recognize and respect the writing and it was very important to the movie .The casting and acting - INCREDIBLE! I mean really - every single person was better than the next . Margot Robbie was absolutely incredible . Every single supporting cast member was so well casted and acted . America Ferrara was amazing and her monologue was probably the highlight of the film and the most powerful part - every woman ( every person ) can relate in some way if not all ways .Hats off to Greta for this film - she took and assignment and got an A+ and then earned some extra credit - one of the great directors .Great film - and I respect it so much as a film - doesn't mean I have to love watching it ( that's what for me makes it an 8 instead of a 10, but honestly it probably deserves an 11)IGo see it - it's absolutely worth it.",Barbie
10.0,"A (meta)philosophical, ethic, physical, artistic and historic masterpiece by Christopher Nolan!",therealveriix,25 July 2023,"Tbh., this has to win every Oscar there is... Cillian Murphy is a genius actor and one of our generation's finest. The cinematography, the plot, the acting, the historic accuracy: just everything is perfect.I've seen quite a lot of bad reviews for this movie, since it doesn't contain action scenes or anything close. At the same time, people are angry because the anticipated nuclear explosion-scene isn't what some hoped for. This movie is about OPPENHEIMER before, during and after the Manhattan Project. It's not about the nuke per se. It is dialogue-heavy and you probably should have some historic context/background for this movie, before you watch it.All in all: MASTERPIECE!",Oppenheimer
4.0,Boringheimer,mtrapp-38034,24 July 2023,"I expected a movie centered around nuclear war and the potential annihilation of the planet to be more captivating, but it just wasn't. Once again Christopher Nolan is semi-redeemed by terrific acting and a great cast, which is perhaps the only redeemable thing about this trash heap of a film. Truthfully I just couldn't wait for it to end...but it just wouldn't.The fact that this is rated so highly absolutely baffles me. Are our standards for film this low now? Last time I throw my money away supporting a film from arguably the most overrated director in the history of film. Christopher Nolan, you are a such a BORE.",Oppenheimer
1.0,"Boring, long and confusing",mbc-27808,23 July 2023,"By the hour and a half mark I was fighting to stay awake, this film is over hyped and convoluted. A good portion of it is just unnecessarily loud sounds for no reason and people yelling at each other. The entire thing felt like a poorly put together indie film festival entry. The explosion that was so hyped up was mediocre at best, I heard it wasn't cgi and that I should be impressed by it but that was not the case. I goto movies in theatre to be wowed, I don't care if it's cgi or 'real' as long as it's impressive and well done.The only way I recommend this movie is if you're looking for something to fall asleep to with it playing in the background. I would give this movie 0/10 if possible for the absolute waste of 3 hours. With all that being said it will probably go on to win academy awards and Oscar's.",Oppenheimer
10.0,Multi Oscar Picture,info-58061,21 July 2023,"Amazing movie, the best I have seen this year. Nolan keeps high class. I think Oppenheimer will win at least 6 Oscars in 2024. Top class actors, even in episodes - like Gary Oldman, Matt Modine, Casey Affleck, etc. Cillian Murphy played his best role and deserves Oscar. Like Robert Dawney Jr. - his play was outstanding. Christopher Nolan deserves his oscar too. Every film detail is perfect. Here is my opinion regarding Oscars: Best actor - Cillian Murphy, Supporting actor - Robert Dawney Jr., Best directing - Christopher Nolan, Best Picture - Oppenheimer, Best original screenplay - Oppenheimer, Best film editing - Oppenheimer.",Oppenheimer
7.0,Unexpected but so enjoyable,alexmetcalfe-29014,22 July 2023,"This plot of Barbie unexpected, I watched it with no real expectations and no other knowledge about what it would be like. Barbie took me by surprise at it had a super deep and meaningful plot on being a woman, what the barbie life is like vs what it actually is like to be a woman. Plus the ken parts were super hilarious, the whole cinema was falling out of our seats at Ryan Gosling, he played Ken so well. And it was great to have these funny moments through out, when some of the parts were more serious. But I wish it had more barbie references, maybe from the movies which is such a memory for me growing up, but it seemed to focus more on Barbies with jobs trying to show that Girls can grow up to do anything, but I guess they couldn't cater to everything as it might've been to hard to squeeze it all it.But other than that this movie was enjoyable, maybe not one of my favourites and I might not watch it again, but seeing it in the cinema was such a great atmosphere and it was fun to see everyone dress up and have fun and laugh together! <3.",Barbie
9.0,Wow! So Good and Right On Time!,ritajeryl,22 July 2023,"I went into Barbie with no expectations, only hopes that it would be entertaining, even if the intended audience is pretty young. Well, I was wrong about the age of the intended audience because obviously the intended audience is me and my fellow 80's babies/90's teens! I absolutely loved it and definitely entertained. I laughed, got teary eyed, and even cheered at times. Margot Robbie shined, Ryan Gosling gave me a new perspective on Ken, and the costumes dazzled. The themes, jokes, and one-liners were actually pretty insightful. Barbie Movie is not all pretty fluff and makeup. It's the MOMENT.",Barbie
10.0,Defenitely worth it!!!,harshitguptaeleventh,23 July 2023,"Like literally amazing, this movie is fantastic the direction, cinematics, acting and each scene of this movie is thrilling. Great storyline and original story too was depicted really well. The originality and quality of this movie is what makes it the best. Its difficult to understand at start but if u have interest in this field, then this movie feels awesome!!Just go and watch it and enjoy the experience!!If u dont have any prior knowledge to the story I would indeed advise people to just watch a short documentary or a youtube video before the movie as it will help u more to understand the plot and experience the movie even more!!!!!!!!",Oppenheimer
7.0,"Entertaining, silly summer movie but not really a funny comedy",strunckjl,23 July 2023,"Overall, this movie was about what I expected. It was a fun, summer blockbuster packed with stars and it felt like a nice, fresh break from all the superhero movies and rehashed stories that have been pushed out lately. It's not perfect, and I feel the messaging at times was too blunt, but the elements of the movie that were silly and enjoyable balanced it outPros: 1) best part of the movie is the soundtrack. I really liked it and the song by Billie Eilish that they played at the end has been replaying in my head ever since 2) the cast is also really good. Robbie and Gosling fit the roles perfectly and did a good job of adding layers to otherwise one-dimensional characters 3) the writing was generally pretty good, and there were several scenes that I feel like packed a decent emotional punchCons: 1) probably my biggest con is that the movie isn't very funny. It's written like it should be a comedy; it's silly, it's fun, and it's entertaining, but the jokes aren't that great. Even though the theatre was full, the audience was very quiet during some of the jokes. For example, Will Ferrell tried very hard, but the role he played didn't really have any good jokes to work with. The movie leaned into the silliness of its world, but seemed afraid to lean into the silliness enough in order to make a truly funny film.",Barbie
6.0,"It swings, and it kinda hits. Kinda.",drawlife,22 July 2023,"BARBIEHEIMER is among us! Between BARBIE and OPPENHEIMER releasing on the same week, the wife really wanted to see this first and I obliged.BARBIE is definitely bound to have some divisiveness due to its ""feminism"" - and yes a lot of feminism (honestly what did you expect). Not addressing this is like not addressing the nuclear bomb in OPPENHEIMER. For a movie about a children's toy, I got to give it some kudos for its subversion and tying to put out a message this big. I'm not shocked that the film focused a bit more on the reality elements of the real world as opposed to the fantasy side. A lot of that is because this is a Greta Gerwig film (co-written with her partner Noah Baumbach) and she is one of the best working director/writer today.The unconventional approach is something to admire. The film swings with these metaphysical ideas and existential crisis. The performances from Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling carry the film. Robbie tackles the role very well. The story asks her to do a lot, and Robbie showcases Barbie's awakening with sincerity, terror, confusion, naivety, humor and bittersweet acceptance. Gosling gets to cut loose and be funny. He goes on his own journey to discovering who he is so there's layers to his Ken as well. He also has a funny rivalry/banter with Simu Liu's Ken.Rest of the supporting cast are a bit underdeveloped, but they get moments to shine here and there and serve the plot in motion. Some highlights are Kingsley Ben-Adir, Issa Rae, Michael Cera and Kate McKinnon.America Ferrara and Ariana Greenblatt are the human mother/daughter duo in the film. Ferrara's character delivers a monolog that is very on the nose and at that point you're with it or meh about it. For me personally, I honestly don't mind it as long as its entertaining, and to the film's credit it was, for at least the first act of the film. It's at its best with the self aware meta humor, but eventually the film gets too carried away and takes itself too seriously, loosing its humor and leaving us experiencing moments that are a bit of a chore to sit through.One could say it was refreshing to watch an incredibly self aware film that isn't afraid to be bold in its message, but for me, while I agree with the underlying message it's very heavy handed and preachy. I connected more when the film explored the nature of Barbie's character. There's one scene that tackles Barbie's legacy directly that raised the existential crisis for her, but it isn't revisited in favor of telling a bigger societal story.Production design, the sets and visuals are very well done. Shoutout to production designer Sarah Greenwood and set decorators Katie Spencer. I feel like Barbie could take home the Oscar for production design. When you're in Barbie Land, the overall usage of pink and the plastic feel makes the whole experience feel immersive. Cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto makes the film feel like you're there. It has a vibrant and inviting energy that you can't help but gaze at.I am curious how some families who saw the film feel about it as some might have expected a more straight forward approach, as opposed to this more nuanced subversive take, but I think overall the film is destined to be enjoyed overall and successful. It just might get a sequel if it can rake in the money, which it looks like it will.As a male, this film isn't made for me. I'm obviously not the target audience for it. However, the film did enough to make me feel engaged where I laughed at some jokes, but the second half is where I felt the film was talking at me instead of engaging me as a viewer. It flirts with being a unique fantasy/real world introspective story, but then seems to be more interested in making a point by the end of it.6/10.",Barbie
10.0,Absolutely Awestruck,jadon-78832,21 July 2023,"Writing this right after leaving the theater, I am absolutely awestruck at the masterpiece I just witnessed. A brilliant and fast paced movie throughout, this movie truly showcases just how good of a writer Nolan is. No other Nolan movie features this much dialogue and reminded me that Nolan's writing is often overshadowed by his directing skills. That being said, I do believe this film features his greatest directing ever. The acting was superb as Cillian Murphy turns in his best performance yet and was able to shine in nearly every scene of this 3 hour epic. The whole supporting cast was great with wonderful cameos all throughout, but I believe Robert Downey Jr. Deserves praise especially. The score perfectly encapsulates the intense nature of the film and even the sound mixing was spot on as my theater was genuinely shaking. The cinematography even rivals that of other impressive Nolan pictures such as Interstellar. This movie was very dense despite being 3 hours long and was truly the fastest 3 hours has ever felt as I still wanted more. This movie is thrilling throughout and will never leave you bored. Being a Nolan film, expect timelines to jump from one point to the next, but I think the way this was edited is truly his best work. I want to take more time to determine where this will fall on my rankings of Nolan's movies but already I know it's top 3. Any Nolan fan knows that being in the top 3 for this list means it is brilliant given the stiff competition. To see this film, myself and a few other Nolan fans were incredibly hyped for this movie for over a year and even drove an hour and a half away to see this movie on an IMAX screen. I now understand why it was so important to witness this spectacle as such because I have never felt more immersed in a movie before. Without a doubt a masterpiece and a perfect 10/10, do yourself a favor and find the biggest screen possible and let yourself be blown away from start to finish. This is Nolan at his finest.",Oppenheimer
5.0,Barbie in-depth review,Faidel_,24 July 2023,"It is undeniable that this film has done excellent marketing and the competition has only enhanced it. With a good cast and good direction, the film goes beyond what may appear or be implied.Clearly, if you go to see this movie you already have an idea of what to expect and what not to expect. However, it does not appeal to all audiences: regardless of the film's intended or interpreted approach, it is not for a child audience and goes beyond the Barbie audience; the film strays too far into different ideals, in some cases, somewhat exaggerated and from a somewhat hypocritical point of view, although they end up being relatively solved at the end of the film.Beyond that, the film is comical and entertaining, without becoming boring throughoust, although it is distinctive and ungainly, without being a positive thing in some specific apects.Barbie is made up of a great team that has done a great job to bring the film to the big screen and reach a lot of people, even though the audience that is really targeted and satisfied is very specific; it might not be the kind of movie you were expecting, not only because of its simple, unrealistic and somewhat absurd plot, but because of the path it takes towards the situation of the moment, represented in a way far from reality because of its absurdity and exaggeration in many aspects (this does not discredit the reality of the general idea of the film, but it does discredit the way it is conveyed).Having said that, the film is never boring, although it can be uncomfortable, absurd and, obviously, unrealistic. Within the limits of fiction, the general idea of the film is clear and understandable, although the plot can be improved and there are a couple of good and charismatic characters. If you are clear about what you are going for and keep in mind what I have said without disliking it, the film will not disappoint you.",Barbie
10.0,Love it. Will be going to see it again.,IanFRobinson,23 July 2023,"Barbie is a modern fantasy with lots of metaphors about existentialism & feminism, and how everybody (men & women) should get equal opportunity. The archetypal Barbie & Ken have fulfilling story arcs. As do the main human characters when Barbie World and the Real World collide. That collision is a big part of making this a fantasy.It looks and sounds great. Its messages are fab. It'll annoy the right people. It's a big-budget Gerwig & Baumbach film. I love their films. I loved this. I'll be making at least one more trip to the cinema to see it again, and it'll be an instant buy when available on iTunes.",Barbie
5.0,Playful idea about the Barbie concept that gets lost in the messy story.,movieman6-413-929510,23 July 2023,"Barbie is a new fantasy comedy directed, part written and produced by Greta Gerwig, director of Lady Bird and Little Women.In Barbieland, everything is perfect and everything runs smoothly. Yet Barbie (Margot Robbie) learns that something is not right and everything suddenly seems less than perfect for her. Because of this, she decides to travel to the real world, to find out what's going on.On this journey she is accompanied by Ken (Ryan Gosling), who secretly tried to go with her. Together they now try to figure out what's going on, but learn that the real world is very different compared to Barbieland.Greta Gerwig, together with the photography director Rodrigo Prieto, knows how to convey the Barbie world well, making it seem as if you are in a life-sized doll's room as a viewer. They used beautiful film sets for this. Thus, the film works well as long as it is set in the Barbieland. Only that everyone here is Barbie or Ken sometimes makes it a bit difficult to follow the exact differences between all Barbies and Kens.When the story moves to the real world, it changes the movie a bit. For example, how exactly it is possible to travel between the two worlds is not really clearly explained. Furthermore, the movie loses credibility when Barbie and Ken can do anything in the real world with no real consequences. Due to the lack of explanation and an eye for detail, the film can sometimes come across as a bit strange.In a comical way, they also try to make fun of both gender roles. For example, Barbieland should represent the opposite of the real world. In Barbieland, Barbies and Kens can do anything, but Barbie is often above Ken. In the real world, men often seem to be above women. For example, they try to divide this role in the opposite way. For male viewers, who do not like these current feminism movements, this can make this film less.Despite multiple actors and actresses playing different Barbies and Kens, Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling manage to portray their roles in more unique ways alongside the other Barbies and Kens cast members. Margot Robbie comes across as a real Barbie, trying to discover what her life destinies really are. Ryan Gosling manages to provide plenty of appropriate comedic moments as Ken, who tries to make Barbie notice him. In the real world, however, he learns that as Ken, he can also do other things without Barbie. Will Ferrell plays the CEO of Mattel, the toy company that makes the barbie doll. His character and the other employees are supposed to be in the real world, but they seem more like they're also in a cartoon world because of the ways they act. This makes the concept of the real world seem a bit unusual. If they brought out the real world a little better, the movie could have been a little better.The Barbie and Ken concept is better brought to the fore in Toy Story 3, for example, where these dolls and the idea they stand for are also handled a bit playfully.",Barbie
8.0,"Overall, very solid",bfvyjym,23 July 2023,"Like most Nolan movies, the writing and cinematography are wonderful. It's a powerful story, that deserves to be told by someone who translate it to the big screen.But, there are some things that are definitely different about this particular Nolan film:1) The sex scenes are awkward and add literally nothing to the film. No spoilers, but if you have younger kids you'll want to research when these are and prepare. Nolan will hopefully go back to not including these scenes for the next 20 years.2) The soundtrack was not typical - at times it was unbelievably loud, almost jarring. I understand this topic is different than most Nolan movies, but even so, you not play have music that isn't a distraction. I'd say this was.I would say, the acting was phenomenal - all around.",Oppenheimer
7.0,Barbenheimer pt. 2,daisukereds,25 July 2023,"Great cinematography, exceptional acting, terrific storytelling!It's not a very entertaining popcorn flick! And one that won't probably have repeat viewing when it becomes available. The length of 3 hours helps a movie that dwells so much into introspective details and storytelling, and isn't really felt when you are in it.. but one that hurts it as a prospective movie to watch on theaters when making the choice. And due to its contents, I would not suggest watching it on IMAX, as a normal theater would work fine.. specially because of the terrible sound muffling the voices! Thank Buddha for subtitles.All in all, it's an easy recommendation for any film lovers, but maybe not for your below-average viewer. Personally, I wouldn't call it Nolan's best, but I can easily understand why.... Now! More than anything, it has been really interesting to see it being promoted as part of the whole ""Barbenheimer"" duo! A movement to celebrate movie going (even if it was forged by the people behind it) that people are taking part of and eating it up.With both movies being are advertised as something that feel like a ""sleight of hand"", depending on how you see it. From a movie that offers all the colors and fun from a known franchise, while seemingly ""hiding its agenda"" from its ad campaign (from what I've heard) or the fact that it isn't really a story for kids.. While Oppenheimer strongly advertised as a film from creative director Nolan (with his ""IMAX gimmick"") being an almost documental movie that focuses mostly on character development and objective and subjective content, and almost no action or ""money shots"". I wonder how many people were tricked by either, seeing how many of the viewers in the theater today left constantly throughout. Personally, can't wait for the second weekend box office numbers!!Is this the last big movie we'll ever get? Well, it was worth it.",Oppenheimer
6.0,"Overhyped movie, had its moments though",hyllus-01262,23 July 2023,"The first half was pretty enjoyable, fun, light, but it took itself too seriously by the second half. No longer allowing the talented cast, especially Gosling, to shine and make us laugh. It felt like the talents of Will Ferrell and Michael Cera were also somewhat underutilized. Interesting concept, had potential, but later in the movie, it definitely started to fall flat for me.Ryan Gosling definitely held this movie together for me, without the laughs he gave me, it would've definitely been lower than 6/10. I think there was just too much of a push to bring politics into the movie. Some is fine, but it enveloped the movie entirely by the end. Whether or not any of the political stuff was accurate, it felt forced and out of place.",Barbie
6.0,"High Highs, Low Lows.",Lk1990,24 July 2023,"The first thing you need to know about Barbie is that Ryan Gosling is the best part of the entire film. For the duration he is over the top, dumb and hilarious. Every scene he was in had me laughing and I enjoyed just about everything he did in the film.Margot Robbie is a great choice for Barbie and as usual puts in a fantastic performance. She hit pretty much every mark in my opinion and I can't see anyone taking her place in this role.Where the film falls flat unfortunately is not the characters, actors or even humour for that matter. It's the incessant political lecturing.It's no surprise that this film takes a strong feminist angle. That's to expected. Barbie was a doll that portrayed many different professions in an attempt to show young girls that they could strive for me than what they were told they could do. But that was the 1950s. This is 2023.By no means is the world a perfect representation of equality today, but it is so vastly superior in that category than it ever has been that the theme of the film falls a little flat. Telling young girls to go after their dreams and not be beholden to any stereotypes is a positive, wonderful message and one that could've been portrayed so much better. But instead, the film teeters on the edge of a radical feminist position.I've seen a lot of people say the film hates men. I disagree with this. I don't think it hates men. Instead, it takes a very simplistic, black and white view of Western culture and assumes that women's lives are overall difficult and men's lives are overall quite easy. When in reality, life is tough. For everyone. At least 99% of us. Claiming otherwise is unjust.However, it's not just the political stance it takes that brings the film down. It's how incessant it is. They are without any shame pushing a political message through the screen down your throat every 10 minutes. It's unbearable at times. Going to the cinema or watching a film should be an enjoyable experience, not a lecture.This film could've been beloved by all genders and ages. Both men and women love Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling. This feels like an easy lay up for the filmmakers but by going the political route they end up having many jokes go over kids heads and alienate many of the people who where genuinely excited to see this film.I give it a 6/10 because of Gosling and most of the humour. It was enjoyable overall. I think Hollywood needs to stop employing multi millionaire actors to lecture the general public on how to live. It's embarrassing.",Barbie
